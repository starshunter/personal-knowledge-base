		- 05:45 #[[Wake Time]]
		- [[Akshay Gandhi]] and [[Asif Hussain]] asked me about [[Aug 31st, 2023]] [[Incident/5532256]] #Uni/Omega
		- [[Uni/Standup]]
		- tried to reproduce the [[Core Dump]] #Incident/5532256 #Uni/Omega
			- found the template version that caused the problem
			- successfully reproduced the mounting path problem, but couldn't generate the [[Core Dump]]
			- [[Uni]] would created `/dev/shm/scoreboards` and `/home/y/var/scoreboards` if it's not mounted
			- collector in the [[Yamas]] sidecar can collect the data
			- still not sure what's the root cause of the incident
	- ## Afternoon
		- studied [[Istio]]
			- seems like [[Uni/Omega]] can use it to achieve [[MTLS]] with other internal services
				- need to verify it
			- but what does it mean to refresh [[ATS]] certificate
				- what certificate needed to be refreshed exactly
				- certificate in `/var/run/athenz` got rotated everyday
