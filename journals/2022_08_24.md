		- [[Fox Wu]] approved my [[Pull Request]] #Sherlock
			- deployed to staging successfully
			- need to insert adult monitoring to violation type table
				- [[Fox Wu]] told me how to do through accessing pod
		- [[PI/Standup]]
	- ## Afternoon

		- gather notes for tomorrow's bi-weekly [[Sherlock/Meeting]]
		  id:: 6306b4fe-6ecc-44ae-996c-7f255ec644b5
			- I found a way to achieve crawling one level down from the domain page we discuss before, so basically it requires one more step before crawling the images, and all it does is to get the links inside the domain page, and filter out those that will take the user out of this domain, then now instead of one url, now we have a bunch of url that all represent the web pages under the referrer domain
			- new version of sherlock has been deployed to staging, and you can try it by accessing yo/sherlockstg, and besides adult monitoring, there's some changes in the UI, like separate page for each violation type, and the uploading page for adult monitoring, and if you find any problems, like bugs, or you have a idea about the design or a feature, you can update this document here, and I will check it every day and implement the idea, so I can show you the changes I've made in our next meeting
			- so I would like to know if I send this url to HLFS, is there any option I can use so that HLFS can get the pages under this domain, because I have studied the document and the protocol buffer file, and I couldn't find any related option
			- so about the jira ticket template, I already put it into Sherlock, but I want to verify one thing, about the images, because I remembered we discussed that we should not put the url in the ticket, so what exactly should I put here, the actual urls or the link to view the urls
			- I have another question about the input file size, so in the input I got, there's 3000 rows in it, will it always be this kind of size in the future
		- the script could not read file using relative path #Sherlock
			- [[PM2]] start the script in app root
			- need to change the relative path
