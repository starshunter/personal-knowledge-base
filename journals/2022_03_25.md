		  title:: Introduction to Pipelining
	- pipelining
	  collapsed:: true
		- a technique to increase the throughput of a system
		- all stages of pipeline run at the same clock speed
		- the notion of an item and associated answer depends on the application
	- elastic vs. inelastic pipeline
	  collapsed:: true
		- inelastic
			- uses registers to separate pipeline stages, all pipeline stages move synchronously
		- elastic
			- uses FIFO to separate pipeline stages, a stage can process data if its input FIFO is not empty and output is not full
