	- ## Midnight
		- 00:53 #[[Bed Time]]
	- ## Morning
		- 05:44 #[[Wake Time]]
		- confirmed [[Uni/5832]] has taken effect in production
		- [[Uni/Standup]]
			- asked [[MingMin Bai]] about [[Uni/5844]]
				- it's not about [[Apache Server]] remapping, it's about [[Uni]] is not returning [[Bing]] host cname in `<bdihost>`
			- got assigned to [[Uni/5857]]
		- [[Yokel Chen]] said we need to rollback change on select tier, and leave ad type in staging #YPI/1678
			- made the change to [[PBob]] UI and made a [[Pull Request]]
			- [[Vincent Chuang]] approved the [[Pull Request]]
			- looked good in staging [[PBob]]
	- ## Afternoon
		- worked on [[Uni/5844]]
			- passed the cname into the `invokeHelper()`
			- in `invokeHelper()`, save the cname for later use
			- created a [[Pull Request]]
		- studied [[Uni/5857]]
			- the `hData` in the url may contain a complete multi layer bucket header
				- don't insert bucket id prefix in this case
			- can find if there's `partner=yh` in `BingExternalExpFromReq` to see if the insertion is needed
			- not sure how to test it, the value of `hData` is encoded
			- need to consider this in the refactoring of [[Apollo]] multi layer logic
