# Daily Log

	- ## Morning
		- 05:46 #[[Wake Time]]
		- [[Uni/Taiwan Sync]]
			- no update on [[Uni/5884]]
			- [[Tomek Majchzak]] thought sending a sample request to test the emitter won't work #Uni/5885
		- [[Janet Lee]] asked when will the bug be fixed #Sherlock
			- replied that she can continue to work on [[Sherlock]]
			- [[Jasmine Basci]] asked to push new violations to production
		- [[PI/Standup]]
		- created [[Pull Request]] for [[Sherlock]] new violations
	- ## Afternoon
		- check `dh_rainbow` code #Uni/5885
			- [[Tomek Majchzak]] thought track name validation is done on remote server side
			- `client_api` actually check if there's a matching track name in the spool directory
			- the tracks in the directory are actually create by `dh_rainbow_configure.sh`
				- not sure how it get executed, guess it's executed during `dh_rainbow_service` start time
			- the script will use an utility library to get track name from an [[Athenz]] token
				- the token need to be fetched by using the config in the configuration file
			- proposed to send a sample event during module initialization
