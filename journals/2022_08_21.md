			- for Sherlock, because there's not much update from MIT about the new input data for adult monitoring, so I finished changing my script to crawl second level from the main page to create the adult monitoring report, so the purpose of this change is to increase the content Sherlock can reach while generating the data, because in the input, there's only one url for each domain, which means Sherlock can only use the content in that page to determine whether the partner has inappropriate content, and of course this method will produce inaccurate result, because it doesn't consider content in other pages, and two level crawling cannot complete resolve this problem, but because it going one level down from the main page and use the content on other pages, so the reachable content is increased, and the result should be more accurate, and after running the script with the sample input, the result is indeed a big improvement compared to the old method, the total number of crawled images increase over 20 times, and eventually found 16 more violations, so if the input data format stay the same in the future, I think two level crawling could serve the need of generating adult monitoring report
			- for Sherlock, the goal for this sprint is to deploy to staging and try generating adult monitoring report to see is there's any bug, and also test the new UI actions added in this version

			- kurata couldn't get back to haneda in time
			- shibuya was waiting at the observation deck
