	- ## Morning
		- 07:20 #[[Wake Time]]
		- [[Uni/Sprint Planning]]
			- got assigned to [[Uni/6576]]
				- wait for [[David Weinman]] to give confirmation on the schema
			- needed further discussion on [[Uni/6570]]
		- review [[HTML]] description with [[Kelly Ke]] #TWHKSRP/3258
			- she thought there's no blocker
			- rare over converting issue can be resolved on their end
			- needed to ask [[Simon Turnbridge]] about question marks in the first parentheses
		- sync up with [[Simon Lee]] #[[YK Data Pipeline/Consolidation]]
			- will need to collect some sample entities from current data pack
			- will also provide [[Wikidata]] id to him
		- worked on [[Uni/6576]]
			- kept the old fields for now
	- ## Afternoon
		- updated current status to [[Simon Turnbridge]] #[[YK Data Pipeline/Consolidation]]
			- he agreed question marks in parentheses can be removed
				- created the [[Pull Request]]
		- [[TW Backend/General Update]]
		- worked on improving the converter #TWHKSRP/3258
			- inline conversion will be directly converted into a map, to avoid double conversion
