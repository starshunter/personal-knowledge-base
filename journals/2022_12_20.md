		- tried to reproduce connection closed because of `wait_timeout` from [[MYSQL]] server #Sherlock
			- when the server send the packet to close the connection, send a query at the same time

		- [[PI/Standup]]
	- ## Afternoon
		- added error handling to the part where sending request to [[Jira]] API is made #Sherlock
