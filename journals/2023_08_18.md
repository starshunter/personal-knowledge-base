		- [[Uni/Standup]]
			- [[MingMin Bai]] wanted me to confirm when will the new [[Pod]] get created when there're two pods #Uni/Omega
				- average [[CPU]] usage or individual
		- verified new [[Pod]] was created when the existing pod [[CPU]] usage is over 50 #Uni/Omega
		- [[Ares Huang]] asked me to submit an expense account for [[Yahoo/Summer Intern]] farewell dinner on [[Aug 24th, 2023]]
		- set the [[Replica Set]] to minimum 2 [[Pod]], maximum 3 pods #Uni/Omega
			- need to create another [[Pull Request]] because the old one can't publish the same package
	- ## Afternoon
		- looks like the third would be created when the average [[CPU]] usage cross 50 #Uni/Omega
	- ## Night
