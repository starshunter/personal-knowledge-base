	- what role exactly man lead is inside the hospital?
	- it appears that female does remember something about her past
	- the case in this episode was not that hard IMO
	- the owner of the hospital seems to be man lead's stepfather, wonder if this will be elaborated further in the future

	  difficulty:: Hard
	  duration:: 15 mins
	- second time solving this problem
	- use custom priority queue
	- to use custom comparator in priority queue, need to first declare the lambda object, than pass that object into priority queue constructor and specify its type using `decltype` #C++ #decltype #[[Priority Queue]]
		- we need to pass the lambda function because it has no constructor, priority queue constructor can only use it by copying it
			- [this link](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50635728/lambda-function-doesnt-work-in-priority-queue-in-c-when-using) explain why
		- `decltype` is used to inspect the type of input variable or expression at runtime
		- the third argument in priority queue constructor is the type of the comparator
		- `priority_queue` return the element with largest priority, so the logic of comparator is the opposite of the logic in `sort`
			- `cmp(a, b)` return true mean `b` has large priority
	- made a stupid mistake, forget to initialize a node variable, stuck for 5 minutes

- [[The Go Workshop/Basic Debugging]] #[[Golang/Debugging]] #[[Golang/Testing]]
	- principles of debugging
		- incremental testing design
		- write unit test
		- handle all the errors
		- logging errors
	- `fmt` package
		- `Print()` prints multiple output in the console, non-string output is separate by space
		- `Println()` prints multiple output in the console, every output is separate by space and new line character is appended at the end
		- `Printf()` prints multiple output using standardize string
	- use `log` for logging
		- `log.Println()` just like `fmt.Println()`, but a timestamp will be added in front of the message
		- use `log.SetFlags()` to configure the logging message
		- `log.Fatal()` will call `os.Exit(1)` after output the message
		- `log.Panic()` will panic after output the message
		- use `log.New()` to create our own logger
			- `<logger> := log.New(<io.Writer interface>, <prefix>, <flags>)` #Golang/Syntax
	- unit test
		- testing file should end with `_test`
		- testing function should start with `Test` and follow by the name of the function being tested, and accept a pointer of type `testing.T`
		- use `go test` to run testing files
		- table driven test
			- test a function with multiple test case
