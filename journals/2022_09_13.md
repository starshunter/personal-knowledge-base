		- had some problems when running the script #Sherlock
			- not updating the status correctly
			- interrupt then reran didn't succeed
		- gather notes for [[PI/Standup]]
			- for Sherlock, yesterday I was adding the uploading history information to the uploading page, but it had some problems showing the file processing status, so I'm using some small sample data to test which step went wrong, and I also studied how to send notification to the users, and it seems like I need to use the corporate mail relaying service to send the mail, so I will go through its onboarding guide today
