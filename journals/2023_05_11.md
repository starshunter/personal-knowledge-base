# Daily Log
	- ## Midnight
		- 23:57 #[[Bed Time]]
	- ## Morning
		- 05:49 #[[Wake Time]]
		- [[Uni/Taiwan Sync]]
			- [[MingMin Bai]] assigned [[Uni/5849]] to [[Trinity Wong]]
			- [[MingMin Bai]] approved and merged [[Pull Request]] for [[Uni/5860]]
			- [[MingMin Bai]] asked us to check one [[Atlas]] test case every time there's a release
		- [[MingMin Bai]] wanted me to check if missing [[Bing]] search service would cause [[Uni]] to return internal error
		- did [[Uni/Release]]
		- [[PI/Standup]]
		- [[Ares Huang]] wanted me to be the mentor of a [[Yahoo/Summer Intern]]
			- there will be a [[KT]] about [[Sherlock]], then I won't need to join [[Reporting/Spring Planning]] in [[2023/Q3]]
	- ## Afternoon
		- checked [[Atlas]] failed test cases
			- a failed test in `Uni_ClickWrapping` is because `CbAd` has deprecated
			- found inconsistent result in `Uni_AccessControl`
				- the tests get 20 lines of log every second for 10 seconds, which may miss the target line
		- investigate error caused by missing service #Uni/5858
			- the error code is 200
			- the error code category is `middleware::MiddlewareCategory`, and [[Uni]] only set error code to 500 if it's from `uni::ModuleCategory`
			- not clear what's the difference between middleware and module here
