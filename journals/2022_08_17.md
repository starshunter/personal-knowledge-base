			- for Sherlock, yesterday after creating a pvc on the Omega, I tried to create a pull request, but the screwdriver pull request job couldn't download a certain package from the internal npm registry, because the artifactory team excluded this external package while fixing a security issue, so the job kept failing, and this issue was reported yesterday and fixed this morning, so now the screwdriver job can run successfully
