# Daily Log
	- ## Midnight
		- [[從JK重新開始的老年計劃/EP8]]
		  collapsed:: true
			- sayuri went back to present time
			- she met ginhi, a former dancer
			- sayuri used government resources to change her life
			- she went back in time again
			- she had to decided what she wanted to do in the future
		- 02:38 #[[Bed Time]]
	- ## Morning
		- 08:24 #[[Wake Time]]
		- gather notes for [[PI/Standup]]
			- yesterday I was studying how to let every Sherlock report to use the same database table to store violation data, I designed the schema and wrote the data retrieving part yesterday, and it works fine so far, so today I will continue to rewrite other functions using this table
		- [[PI/Standup]]
		- change jira handler to use same fact table #Sherlock
	- ## Afternoon
		- use only one exclusion list #Sherlock
			- DONE not sure the condition of SQL query of updating and deleting is correct
		- change the script to write the fact data into the table #Sherlock
			- also changed the behavior to allow user to overwrite previous fact data
			- DONE need to figure out a way to handle user uploads new input data while the script is running
				- [[Aug 1st, 2022]]
				- input format will be `input_data_{TIME_ID}.txt`
				- working file will be `working.txt`
				- finished input data will be `finished_{TIME_ID}.txt`
	- ## Night
		- change fact table's `start_week` into `start_time` #Sherlock
			- `current_time` is a reserved keyword in [[MYSQL]], so I used `current_timepoint` instead
