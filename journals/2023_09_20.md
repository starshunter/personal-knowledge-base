		- [[Tomek Majchzak]] thought it's not necessary to dig into the [[Core Dump]] to find what actually happened #Uni/6010
			- as long as the library [[Uni]] used is not [[Thread/Safe]], it's our job to use it correctly
			- still had some doubts about whether the library is [[Thread/Safe]]
		- [[Nicky Soh]] helped to created a new [[Athenz]] role for [[ScrewDriver]] pipeline #Uni/6024
		- [[Ruby Loo]] asked if I have checked with the team that use [[Merchant Review]] #Uni/5932
			- not yet
		- [[Allen Hsieh]] needed to add new services to [[Athenz]] role #Sherlock #[[Insight API]]
			- [[Amar Kamat]] asked me to approve the request
		- the [[ScrewDriver]] pipeline can successfully update [[Service Entries]] #Uni/6010
			- even after adding [[CA Certificate]] to [[Destination Rule]], the routing still didn't work
		- [[TW Backend/Standup]]
	- ## Afternoon
		- tried to use staging [[VMBridge]] endpoint #Uni/6010
			- seems like there's already a [[Virtual Service]] for this endpoint
			- also tried [[User Location]] endpoint and got the same result
			- [[Isotope]] endpoint is on [[AWS]], and is a post request
		- looks like if the service already enabled [[Istio/Gateway]], then there will be a corresponding [[Virtual Service]] #Uni/6010
			- current method could only work on external service
			- tried [[Geo Info]] endpoint and succeeded
