		- gather notes for [[PI/Standup]]
			- for Sherlock, yesterday I fixed the issue of not being able to write violation data into the database after the script finished executing, and now, I plan to deploy Sherlock to staging next week after I get the jira ticket template from MIT, so now I'm updating the YDS schema so that Sherlock can query it to display adult monitoring report after I deploy
		- [[PI/Standup]]
		- discussed with [[Fox Wu]] about deploying [[Sherlock]] to staging
			- he agreed
			- created an [[Pull Request]] to update [[YDS]] schema
				- I should create PR for dev, staging and production
				- [[Fox Wu]] suggested me not to create a new column `violation_referrer_domain`
					- use existing `referrer_domain` instead
					- also need to modify code
	- ## Afternoon
