# Daily Log

	- ## Morning
		- 08:23 #[[Wake Time]]
		- gather notes for [[PI/Standup]]
			- for sherlock, yesterday I was fixing the bug that cause the violations not showing in frontend, and today I will to check the domains that are marked as inaccessible by the script, because these domains consist almost 20% of the input, and I want to make sure they are truly inaccessible, not some problems cause by HLFS
	- ## Afternoon
		- [[Clement Staff Meeting]]
		- checked domains that are marked as blocked #Sherlock
			- some of them are accessible through browser
			- [[HLFS]] gave indefinite result
				- sometimes domains that are blocked would return 200 success
	- ## Night
		- [[invert城塚翡翠倒敘集/EP1]]
