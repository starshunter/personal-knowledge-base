		- [[Uni/Taiwan Sync]]
			- [[MingMin Bai]] asked me to review [[Trinity Wong]]'s [[Pull Request]] for [[Uni/5807]]
			- to check with [[Luojian Chen]] to see if he already got what he need #Uni/5838
			- can start working on refactoring [[Uni]] multilayer bucket logic
		- reviewed [[Uni/5807]]
	- ## Afternoon
		- refactored [[Uni]] multilayer bucket logic
			- created a new class `GalileoBucket`
				- contains layer-bucket mapping, and some variables to help building the header
			- simplified the logic in `RequestParserModule`
				- only need to get the mapping
				- decided what to put in layer 0 header
			- had some problem compiling the change
				- need to overload the `<<` operator in the new class
				- still couldn't compile
