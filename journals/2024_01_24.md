		- [[MingMin Bai]] assigned [[Uni/6295]] to me
			- needed to add [[SonarQube]] into [[Uni]]
		- worked on [[Uni/6295]]
			- [[ScrewDriver]] doesn't support [[SonarQube]] natively for [[C++]]
				- needed to use a build wrapper when building [[Uni]]
			- setup a personal [[ScrewDriver]] pipeline for testing
			- the wrapper kept throwing error
				- seems to be a know issue
				- can still see the result in UI
		- [[Tomek Majchzak]] merged [[Uni/6274]] [[Pull Request]]
	- ## Afternoon
		- couldn't resolve the error thrown by build wrapper #Uni/6295
			- there's also no [[Code Coverage]] in [[SonarQube]] UI
			- tried `gmake testcoverageplatforms` to get the coverage report first
		- [[Tomek Majchzak]] assigned [[Uni/6296]] to me
	- ## Night
		- [[因為妳獻上了妳的心/EP3]]
			- ame will lose her sense of smell next
			- her grandmother had cancer, but didn't tell her
			- ame realized the sense of smell can bring back a lot of happy memory
			- taiyou confessed to her, but she didn't accept it
			- she didn't want him to get hurt
		- [[再見Maestro/EP2]]
			- shunpei's wife wanted him and his daughter to make up
			- the orchestra decided to recruit more member before its dissolvement
			- hibiki was assigned to cleanup the orchestra's scores
			- a student wanted to join the orchestra and be a conductor
			- the orchestra successfully recruited a new flutist and a new cellist
