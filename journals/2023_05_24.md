		- [[MingMin Bai]] not sure how to solve the problem I asked #Uni/5885
			- [[Tomek Majchzak]] wanted to discuss the implementation with me
			- to discussed more details [[May 25th, 2023]]
		- attend [[Scrum]] training
	- ## Afternoon
		- try creating config file in [[Unit Test]] constructor #Uni/5885
			- need to create a directory `/var/spool/dh_rainbow/data` as well, somehow it still can't create a `SocketStream` even I add `spool_disable=true` to the config file
			- to discuss this method [[May 25th, 2023]]
