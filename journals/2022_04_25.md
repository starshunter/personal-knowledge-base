- learn `break` and `continue` label in Java #Loop #[[Control Flow]] #Break #Continue
	- labels are used to mark loops in Java
		- ```Java
		  label 1:
		    for(int i=0; i<10; i++) {
		      label 2:
		        for(int j=0; j<10; j++) {
		          System.out.println(i, j);
		        }
		    }
		  ```
	- put `break` before a label can break the loop marked by the label, which means the control flow is handed to the statement after the marked loop
	- put `continue` before a label an skip the remaining statements in the loop marked by that label
