# Daily Log
	- ## Midnight
		- 01:48 #[[Bed Time]]
	- ## Morning
		- 08:26 #[[Wake Time]]
		- the violations didn't show up in the frontend #Sherlock
			- the data was indeed in [[YDS]]
			- the current timestamp is wrong, which cause `rollup_status` to be `null`
				- because now Sherlock allows users to upload input file for current month
			- filed a [[Pull Request]] to fix it
				- [[Fox Wu]] approved it
		- gather notes for [[PI/Standup]]
			- for sherlock, the adult monitoring script finished running in production, and the data was written into database, but frontend couldn't show the violation on the page, so I'm checking the SQL query the frontend use to see where's the problem
		- [[PI/Standup]]
	- ## Afternoon
		- the email [[Sherlock]] sent didn't include duration, not sure why
		- [[Clement One on One]]
			- mentioned about more works
		- tried to trigger credit card ads, still unable to do it #Uni/5714
		- saw [[Junye Lu]] has a [[Pull Request]] about adding logging in [[UNI]]
			- need to add logging for credit card ads as well #Uni/5714
	- ## Night
		- [[Atomä¹‹ç«¥/EP6]]
			- umi went back to work at bank
			- hayato worked at the car industry
			- nayuta worked two part time jobs
			- he and hayato built a game to teach children how to walk safely in the city
			- their game couldn't get accepted by the school
			- an insurance company bought the game
			- they used the money to bought back atom's place and created their own company
