		- gather notes for [[PI/Standup]]
			- for me, yesterday I finished the email notification part of adult monitoring report, so the requests from MIT are all implemented, and I will create the PR today, and this morning, there's a ad extension from UNI, so I will read the document I got first to understand the requirements
