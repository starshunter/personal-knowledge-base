	- send a GET request to server
		- use `http.Get()`
		- the response's body should be closed after finishing our operation
		- the response's body is a `io.Reader` interface, use `io.ReadAll()` to read
			- if the body contains JSON, than use `json.Unmarshal()` to extract JSON data to struct
	- send a POST request to server
		- use `http.Post()`
		- in addition to URL, content-type and a body are required in POST request
			- use `bytes.NewBuffer()` to create body
	- use custom flags for requests
		- we can create our own request using `http.NewRequest()`
			- `func NewRequest(method, url string, body io.Reader) (*Request, error)`
		- use request method `Header.Set()` to set header
		- then use `http.Client.Do()` to send this request
- learn CSRF #Learning/Work #Security #Backend #[[Job Interview]]
	- cross site request forgery
	- malicious user forge a request on the victim's behave, and the server doesn't check if the request is really sent by the victim, results in unpredictable behavior
	- elements of CSRF attack
		- action to trigger malicious script
		- only one authentication is implemented
		- only use cookie to autheticate
	- how to prevent CSRF
		- check the referer of the request
			- browser may not support, or user may disable it
		- add another authentication method
			- bothersome
		- add CSRF token
			- return an unique, unpredictable CSRF token every time the user requests a page, and save that token in server session, so when the user submit the form, server can check if the token in the form is matched with the token in the session
			- need to disable cross origin request, or else malicious site can retrieve CSRF token
		- send a cookie containing CSRF token with CSRF token
			- the cookie need to have same-site property
			- server doesn't need to store the token, just compare the two when receiving a form

	  title:: Chapter 5: Process Scheduling
	- CPU scheduler
		- select a process in ready queue to be executed
			- ready queue contains PCB
		- ready queue implementation varies
		- CPU scheduling take places when a process
			- switches from running to waiting
			- terminates
			- switches from running to ready
			- switches from waiting to ready
		- scheduling happens only in first two cases is said to be nonpreemptive
		- preemptive scheduling usually has better performance, but protection for synchronization need to be done
		- some OS will do context switch only after a system call is completed
	- dispatcher
	  id:: 6203e0f4-471b-48f3-8ea8-9a1038c29bd6
		- a module to transfer control of CPU to the process selected by CPU scheduler
		- responsible for
			- switching context
			- switching to user mode
			- jumping to the proper location in the user program
	- scheduling criteria
		- CPU utilization
			- utilization of CPU
		- throughput
			- number of processes that complete in the given time
		- turnaround time
			- amount of time to execute a process
			- sum of the time in ready queue, execute on CPU, wait for I/O...
		- waiting time
			- the time a process waiting in the ready queue
		- response time
			- the time between a process being submitted and the first response is produced
	- scheduling algorithms
		- first-come, first served
			- managed with FIFO queue
			- nonpreemptive
			- average waiting time is not minimal and vary substantially
			- convoy effect
				- other processes wait for one big process to finish CPU execution
		- shortest-job-first scheduling
			- measure the length of the process's next CPU burst and sort then in ascending order
			- result in minimum average waiting time
				- but it's unrealistic to assume we know the execution time of every process
			- use exponential average to predict CPU burst length
			- can be preemptive or nonpreemptive
		- priority scheduling
			- a priority is associated with each process
			- CPU is allocated to the process with highest priority
			- can be preemptive or nonpreemptive
			- starvation
				- low priority processes can be blocked for a long time
				- use aging, allow process to gradually increase it priority
		- round-robin scheduling
			- FCFS scheduling but add preemption
			- a time quantum is defined
			- average waiting time of RR is often long
		- multilevel queue scheduling
			- processes are classified into different groups
			- each queue has its own scheduling algorithm
			- there must be scheduling among queues
		- multilevel feedback-queue scheduling
			- processes are allowed to move between queues
			- process move down if it uses too much CPU, and move up when it waits too long in low priority queue
	- multiple-processor scheduling
		- asymmetric multiprocessing
			- system activities are handled by a master server
		- symmetric multiprocessing
			- processors are self scheduling
		- if one process migrates to another processor, the cache must migrate too
			- most system avoid process migration, known as processor affinity
		- load balancing
			- keep the workload balanced among all processor
			- push migration
				- a kernel process push process from overloaded processor to idle processor
			- pull migration
				- idle processor pull process from overloaded processor
	- thread scheduling
		- user threads are mapped onto kernel threads, and kernel threads are being scheduled by OS
		- user threads compete in process-contention scope, and kernel threads compete in system-contention scope
	- algorithm evaluation
		- deterministic modeling
			- simple and fast
			- need a predetermined workload
			- the evaluation only reflect the performance on that specific case
		- queueing model
		- simulations

	  title:: Chapter 6: Synchronization
	- race condition
		- several processes access and manipulate the same data concurrently, and the outcome of the execution depends on the order in which the access takes place
		- to prevent, we need to make sure only one process at a time can manipulate shared data
	- critical section
		- a segment of code where processes may modify some shared resources
		- we need to design a protocol that no two process can execute critical section at the same time
		- protocol must satisfy
			- mutual exclusion
				- if one process is executing, then no other processes can execute
			- progress
				- if there is no process executing critical section
				- there exist multiple processes wish to execute critical section
				- then those processes that are not executing remainder section can compete for executing critical section
				- this decision cannot be postponed indefinitely
			- bounded waiting
				- a bounded time must exist after a process request to execute critical section
		- kernel is free from race condition if it doesn't allow a process executing in kernel space to be preempted
		- but kernel are normally preemptive, because the performance is better
	- Peterson's solution
		- software based solution
		- restricted to two process
		- ((6203e984-8f74-43ec-83cf-49c37170ec98))
			- mutual exclusive is satisfied because we set `turn` to another process before the request
				- so only one process will enter critical section even if both processes make the request
			- progress is satisfied because there always have one process that can enter critical section
			- bounded-waiting is satisfied because a process must set its flag to false after executing critical section, so even if it request to enter critical section again, the other process will execute first
	- synchronization hardware
		- many system provides hardware support for critical section like atomic hardware instructions
		- test and modify
			- ((6203ecd1-b27d-4e28-b950-9bbacf5aa954))
			- ((6203ed2d-3529-42a3-8067-c5f9f96782e8))
		- swap
			- ((6203ecf1-29a1-4e8b-91fb-749eab2ffdb2))
			- ((6203ed3f-19f9-45b9-bb99-f408a37ce098))
			-
		- the above two solution only satisfy mutual exclusion
		- ((6203edd5-43fb-450c-b7fd-0dead8d729a2))
			- mutual exclusion is satisfied because only one `waiting` is set to false
			- progress is satisfied because an exiting process will let another process to enter
			- bounded-waiting is satisfied because the exiting process search next process in a circular order
	- semaphores
		- semaphore is an integer
		- can only be accessed through `wait()` and `signal()`
			- ((6203efe7-3b36-4592-b8ba-7a9200957710))
		- binary semaphore
			- mutex lock
			- range from 0 to 1
			- deal with critical section problem
		- counting semaphores
			- used to control access to a resource with finite number of instances
		- implementation
			- semaphores require busy waiting
			- or the process can block itself
				- the process is placed into a waiting queue associated with that semaphore
				- when another process execute `signal()`, one waiting process will be placed into ready queue
			- `wait()` and `signal()` have to be atomic
		- deadlock and starvation
			- deadlock occurs when two or more processes are waiting indefinitely for an event that can be caused by only one of the waiting processes
			- starvation occurs when a process never get executed
	- the bounded-buffer problem
		- ((6203f49b-ca51-46f1-958b-4c91369026ea))
			- `empty` represent the number of empty buffers
			- `full` represent the number of full buffers
	- the readers-writers problem
		- if a writer and some other readers or writers access the database at the same time, chaos may happen
		- writers must have exclusive access to the database
		- ((6203f82e-2979-4270-9488-e6b40fd68288))
		- ((6203f83f-da91-4a6e-9aea-04e87c529af2))
		-
	- the dining-philosophers problem
		- ((6203f83f-da91-4a6e-9aea-04e87c529af2))
		- ((6203f83f-da91-4a6e-9aea-04e87c529af2))
	- monitors
		- high level constructs to make programming easier
		- a collection of procedures, variables and data structures that are all grouped together
		- only one process can be active in a monitor at any instance
			- monitor handles the critical section problem by itself
		- we still need to let process block when it cannot proceed
			- processes that cannot proceed will block on condition variable
			- use `wait()` on condition variable to block itself
			- use `signal()` to wake a process that is blocked on the same condition variable
