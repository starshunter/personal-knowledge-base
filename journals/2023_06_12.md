		- 05:31 #[[Wake Time]]
		- [[Janet Lee]] reported a bug about image count in fact data didn't get updated #Sherlock
			- no log about it
			- use transaction to ensure image status and fact data are consistent
				- wait till [[Jun 13th, 2023]] for the new violations to finish to create the [[Pull Request]]
			- delete the stall fact data and replied the email
	- ## Afternoon
		- checked how [[Uni]] handle [[Syndi]] response #Uni/5900
			- there's no `adId` in web result
				- it only exists in ad
			- found a request on [[Splunk]] to get ads
				- `impressionId` was successfully printed
				- can't print the [[Bing]] response of this request, need to find another one
			- still not clear why [[Syndi]] treats web response as ads in the output
		- [[Tomek Majchzak]] left some review in [[Pull Request]] for [[Uni/5861]]
			- changed the place of appending `dnsc=1`
			- initialized `wrappedUrl` with unwrapped value
			- updated [[Pull Request]]
