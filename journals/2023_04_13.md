# Daily Log
	- ## Midnight
		- 00:10 #[[Bed Time]]
	- ## Morning
		- 05:45 #[[Wake Time]]
		- there's a [[Incident]] in [[OpenStack]]
			- [[Uni]] also got impacted
			- [[Uni/Release]] was canceled
				- [[Mingmin Bai]] will take over the release tomorrow if the situation is stable
			- [[Uni/Taiwan Sync]] was canceled
		- studied [[Byfor]] #Uni
			- it will pre-resolve the hosts listed in the config file after starting up
				- the result should be saved in local storage, and later be retrieved when it intercept a call to [[DNS]]
			- studied how it reads config file, and what do the config file options mean
		- [[PI/Standup]]
	- ## Afternoon
		- [[OpenStack]] [[Incident]] was resolved
			- [[Uni]] [[QA]] host was accessible again
		- studied [[Byfor]] #Uni
			- it reads and store configuration in the [[Data Structure]] defined in [[Protocol Buffer]] and [[Flat Buffer]] file
				- first load to [[Protocol Buffer]], then transform it to [[Flat Buffer]] to store in local storage
				- need to compile the `.proto` and `.fbs` file to see the actual [[Data Structure]]
			- after finishing reading the config file, it spawns a [[Thread]] for each rotation
				- a rotation is defined in the config file, starting with `name`
			- it should be able to intercept calls to [[glibc]] and resolve the request locally
				- [[Uni]] uses `gethostbyname` and `gethostbyname_r`
				- not sure if there's a log file for this
