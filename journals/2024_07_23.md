- # Daily Log
	- ## Midnight
		- 00:00 #[[Bed Time]]
	- ## Morning
		- 07:20 #[[Wake Time]]
		- [[Uni/Sprint Planning]]
			- got assigned to [[Uni/6590]] and [[Uni/6591]]
				- [[Uni/6591]] was already implemented
		- sync-up with [[Simon Lee]] #[[YK Data Pipeline/Consolidation]]
			- confirmed what attributes needed further mapping
			- discussed my finding in the initial extraction result
				- needed to add latitude and longitude for `Place` and all its subclass
				- needed to implement `label` fallback mechanism
					- I will take a look
	- ## Afternoon
		- worked on [[Uni/6591]]
			- too many new fields, asked [[David Weinman]] for documentation
			- finished initial implementation in [[Uni/AWE]]
		- unusual [[QPS]] hitting [[Uni/AWE]]
			- [[Layer 7]] not blocking those traffic
			- [[Uni]] [[Pod]] handled the traffic just fine
