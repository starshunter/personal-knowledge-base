# Daily Log

		- gather notes for [[PI/Standup]]
			- yesterday I was fixing some problems I found when testing my Sherlock script, the main issue was it can't correctly recognize which request has been sent in the previous execution, and this issue has been resolved, and yesterday [[Chih-Yu Ko]] also walked me through the idea of redesigning Sherlock's homepage, so that each violation type can have its table with custom columns, so I will work on this today, I plan to first look at the overall project structure to have a better understanding of which APIs or pages need to be change in order to make this new homepage
		- [[PI/Standup]]
	- ## Afternoon
		- removed unnecessary columns in each violation table
			- columns marked in the MITProductRequests spread sheet are not accurate, see `Sherlock_oozie`'s hive script instead
	- ## Night
		- make a sidebar to access each table on any page
		- add an application bar at the top
