- # Daily Log
	- ## Midnight
		- 00:00 #[[Bed Time]]
	- ## Morning
		- 05:37 #[[Wake Time]]
		- [[Simon Turnbridge]] confirmed entities with different types can't be reconciled #[[YK Data Pipeline/Consolidation]]
			- discussed more potential solutions
			- he suggested to edit [[Wikidata]] directly
				- over 5k entities are impacted, not realistic
			- if we don't infer `Producer`, the relation will get dropped
		- [[Simon Turnbridge]] suggested `TriplesGraphFilter` may have caused the disambiguation text issue #[[YK Data Pipeline/Consolidation]]
			- if we have a source that is not `wiki-zh`, it shouldn't cause any problem
	- ## Afternoon
		- [[YK Data Pipeline/Consolidation]] [[Meeting]]
			- updated current status
			- discussed entities not recon problem
				- [[Dau-Heng Hsu]] suggested asking [[CAKE Team]] about not extracting producer before exploring other options
		- [[Kelly Ke]] said [[CAKE Team]] can finish [[YK Data Pipeline/Consolidation]] review before [[Sep 12th, 2024]]
		- investigated how many entities are impacted by the producer issue #[[YK Data Pipeline/Consolidation]]
			- over 1k entities may get impacted
		- updated my findings to [[Kelly Ke]] #[[YK Data Pipeline/Consolidation]]
			- asked if we need to extract producer
