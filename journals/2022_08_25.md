		- bi-weekly [[Sherlock/Meeting]]
			- [[Raman Dokka]] introduced [[Sieve]]

			- [[Jasmine Basci]] eventually decided to put image urls inside the [[Jira]] ticket
		- [[Fox Wu]] held a [[Sherlock/Meeting]]
			- discussed about [[Sieve]]
			- talked about the high level process
			- some questions needed to be carify
				- what's in the response
				- how long should we wait before getting the newest response
		- [[Fox Wu]] thought it's unnecessary to use [[Sieve]] #Sherlock
			- he asked me to share my current progress with [[MIT Team]]
		- [[PI/Standup]]
	- ## Afternoon
		- filed a [[Pull Request]] to fix the relative path issue #Sherlock
		- found a lot of 628 politeness error from [[HLFS]] #Sherlock
