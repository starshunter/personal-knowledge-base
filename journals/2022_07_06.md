		- gather notes for [[PI/Standup]]
			- for Sherlock, yesterday I was updating the dependencies, and because some packages need to update to higher major versions, I spent some time figuring out which new peer dependencies need to install, and because the package used to build the UI was also update to another major version, so the styling is a little off right now, I plan to study how to migrate it to the newer version, and hopefully I can create the pr today
		- [[PI/Standup]]
		- fixed UI #Sherlock
		- submitted [[Pull Request]] #Sherlock
		  id:: 62c54837-3769-46b6-81d2-dfee0529473d
	- ## Afternoon
		- updated dependencies in my development branch #Sherlock
			- kept getting errors, decided to start over
		- [[Clement One on One]]
			- talked about what I'm doing lately
			- [[Clement Lee]] said he would let me work on some other projects
		- [[Fox Wu]] approved my [[Pull Request]] ((62c54837-3769-46b6-81d2-dfee0529473d))
		- my [[Pull Request]] was failed to deploy on staging environment
	- ## Night
		- prepared for tomorrow's [[Sherlock/Meeting]]
		  id:: 62c4f4c3-bb65-4274-87b1-aedefedc0108
		  collapsed:: true
			- {{embed ((62c4f4c4-334c-42cd-a681-f14656539c2b))}}
			- {{embed ((62c4f4c4-98ec-40ee-8891-62e91dccd7d2))}}
			- so because I still don't have access to HLFS, there's not much update on adult monitoring report
			- and for Sherlock, last week [[Chih-Yu Ko]] told me about an idea of a new home page design, because right now on Sherlock's homepage, there this huge table uses many columns to display different metrics, but not every violation type needs all those metrics, some violation type only needs one or two of them, so this kind of display makes the data representation very sparse, and if there are more violation type need to add to Sherlock in the future, this table may grow even bigger, so what I think of and what I'm doing now is to let each violation type to have its stand-alone table, and in each table it will only display the metrics that violation type needs, so no more metric with empty entry, so take this violation for example, in the rollup view, it only need to display this metric, bidded result, and in the violation view, it only need to show its referrer domain and bidded result, so if we go to the table of this violation type, we can see, it only display what the violation needs in both rollup view and violation view, so I hope these stand-alone tables can make the ui more intuitive, but I will also retain all-in-one table, so if you are already used to doing your work on it you can still use the original one
			- about adult monitoring report, last time we talked about showing the market of a violation on the UI, but I'm not sure if it's possible to include the market information inside the input data
