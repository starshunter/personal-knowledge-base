		- 05:42 #[[Wake Time]]
		- bi-weekly [[Sherlock/Meeting]] with [[MIT Team]]
			- they wanted to make some small logic changes on the two new violations
			- [[Janet Lee]] reported a bug that some closed violations were brought up again by new nsfw image violation
		- [[Uni/Taiwan Sync]]
		- worked on putting stream from a terminated thread back to pool #Uni/5885
			- the stream [[Uni]] can access is a `shared_ptr`, but the pool can only take raw [[Pointer]]
			- asked [[Tomek Majchzak]] if he has better idea
		- [[PI/Standup]]
			- [[Will Kuo]] joined the [[TW Backend]]
	- ## Afternoon
		- [[Tomek Majchzak]] gave some thoughts on [[Uni/5885]]
			- he thought the refactoring can be done in the module, no need for additional service
			- he thought check the stream initialization once is enough
			- discussed some specific details
			- he just wanted to point out a new service is not necessary
		- decided to finish current implementation #Uni/5885
			- need more information from [[MingMin Bai]]
				- will [[YDisc]] retires threads during its lifetime?
				- can we initialize new stream at runtime, if we already check it in module initialization?
			- wrote a new version of pool that stores [[Smart Pointer]]
		- made a draft about [[Trending Now]] preview #[[Yahoo/Summer Intern]]
