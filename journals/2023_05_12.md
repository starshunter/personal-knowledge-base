		- [[MingMin Bai]] left some reviews in the [[Pull Request]] for [[Uni/5817]]
			- addressed
		- assigned to [[Uni/5788]], [[Uni/5884]] and [[Uni/5885]]
		- [[Uni/Standup]] was canceled
		- not sure about the description in the [[Jira]] ticket of [[Uni/5788]]
	- ## Afternoon
		- studied [[Uni/5884]]
			- the image SRP wanted to implement related images after clicking an image
			- there's 2 APIs from [[Microsoft]] listed in the PRD
				- not sure which one to use
			- used [[Postman]] to make request to the APIs
				- for visual search API, the AppId [[Uni]] uses doesn't have access
				- for image insights API, can't get the similar images, but can get other insights like related search
