		- [[Uni/Code/BingSearchModule]]
			- use [[Uni/Code/BingSearchService]] to send the request to Bing
			- `run()`
				- main execution
				- `pService` is the pointer that call [[Uni/Code/BingSearchService]]
					- `invokeHelper()` to call `invoke()` of [[Uni/Code/HttpService]]
			- `moduleCallBack()`
				- add monitor event based on the parsed Bing response
				- passed into [[Uni/Code/BingSearchService]] `invokeHelper()`
				- set monitoring event for each type of ad
				- get layout id for site links
		- [[Uni/Code/BingSearchService/BingSearchResponseParser]]
			- parse Bing raw response into [[Uni/Code/BingLibrary/BingResponse/BingSAXData]]
			- `BingResponseData` is an alias of share pointer of `BIngSAXData`
			- `parseJsonToBingSAXData()`
				- root function, invoke other smaller functions
				- invoked by [[Uni/Code/BingSearchService]] `deserialize()`
				- need to parse the response type first
				- each response type has a set of functions to be invoked to complete the parsing
			- `parseJsonToBingAd()`
				- function to parse the ad part of Bing response
				- invoked by `parseJsonToBingSAXData()`
				- there are some fields, along with an array of ad objects
					- each ad object need to be parsed by the function corresponding to the type of the ad
