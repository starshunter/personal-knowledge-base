		- [[Justine Mock]] add fiddler trace file to [[Uni/5714]] [[Jira]] ticket
		- gather notes for [[PI/Standup]]
			- for Uni, yesterday I was studying the credit card ads request, and I had some questions regarding the trigger terms and the output schema for search front end, so I will gather my questions and clarify them with PM, and today I will focus more on the implementation detail to see which modules are involved in this task
		- [[PI/Standup]]
	- ## Afternoon
		- wrote the part that could add `CreditCardAds` to `adTypesFilter`
			- tested it in [[QA]] box
			- couldn't get the response with credit card ad
		- asked some questions in [[Jira]] ticket for [[Uni/5714]]
			- trigger terms
			- output format
			- attribute for [[SFE]]
		- studied [[Uni]] code
			- had a question about the position of credit card ad
			- not sure it's a new position, or it's the same as the old one but with another name
