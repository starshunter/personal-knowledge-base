			- for Sherlock, I developed the ui of the adult monitoring report base on the mock up I received
			- while the ui requirement is very similar to the existing search policy violation table, since the metrics used in the two reports are different, I decided to put the adult monitoring report on a separate page, and MIT is ok with this method
			- this report consists of two views, a rollup view and a violation view
			- in rollup view, you get an overview of the referrer domains that have been found containing adult images
			- and by expanding a row in rollup view, you enter the violation view, user can identify which source tags are tied to this domain, you can use the drop down to inspect the detail of the violation in different months, you can also check the images that have been considered as not safe for work, or directly issue a ticket and has the partner manager handle the issue
			- since the layout of this report and the data retrieving functions are very similar to search policy violation report, I also wrote this page and its handlers into a react component, so if Sherlock needs to add a new report in the future, and it requires the same two level structure to present its data, this new component can be used to create that report
			- so for adult monitoring report, the development process is still blocked by not getting access to HLFS, the admins haven't started to process or responded to the request yet, and MIT helped to push the request last week, hopefully they can grant be to use the service soon, so I can continue to write the script to crawl actual images from partners' referrer domains
			- at the same time, I will look into how to use stateful sets on omega, which will allow the script sending requests to HLFS and SMP to preserve its input data and responses from the services across restarts, so no duplicate requests will be sent after restart
