# Daily Log
	- ## Midnight
		- 23:54 #[[Bed Time]]
	- ## Morning
		- 05:41 #[[Wake Time]]
		- worked on low [[TQ Score]] on YHS violation #Sherlock
			- made a basic [[Hive]] query to calculate the weighted [[TQ Score]]
				- needed to ignore the item when it has null [[TQ Score]]
			- added more conditions based on the given logic
			- tested on [[Hue]]
		- [[Reporting/Spring Planning]]
	- ## Afternoon
		- found out I used the wrong table to calculate the weighted [[TQ Score]] #Sherlock
			- it doesn't contain ptqs for each source tag
			- dig into [[PI/Database]] codebase to find out how it get `source_ptqs`
				- turned out it directly used the `traffce_quality_score` from the fact table
				- need to confirm this with [[Jack Chiang]]
			- rewrote the [[Hive]] query and tested on [[Hue]]
			- asked some questions on the working document
				- how to filter on implementation, seems like it's not presented in [[Apollo]] feed
				- condition about minimum revenue
