		- checked how's the new violation type doing in [[Sherlock]] staging
			- the deployment of frontend was failed
				- successful after redeploying
			- can't open violation detailed page because the column config was incorrect
			- created a [[Pull Request]] to fix it
		- reviewed [[Uni/5789]]
	- ## Afternoon
		- [[Tomek Majchzak]] clarified his concerned about [[Uni/5788]]
			- `dnsc=1` should not append to external url
			- for review extension, only those that are billable will have redirect url to [[Bing]], and [[Uni]] should append `dnsc=1` to those urls
				- need to confirm this
		- [[Ares Huang]] asked me to go to the office to welcome [[Yahoo/Summer Intern]] on [[Jul 4th, 2023]]
		- ran performance test again for [[Uni/5885]]
			- control group was still slightly better than test group, but the margin has shrink
