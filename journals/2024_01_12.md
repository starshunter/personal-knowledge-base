		- [[Uni/Standup]]
			- another [[Core Dump]] happened yesterday on a [[Bare Metal]] host, immediately after the release
				- similar to what happened fews months ago #Uni/6010
		- tried to get the queries around the crash period #Uni #[[QNS Panama]]
	- ## Afternoon
		- [[Tomek Majchzak]] has some thought about [[Uni/6010]]
			- the hash table in the monitoring library uses `memcmp`, which may not compare the strings byte by byte
			- the library doesn't check the length of the string to be compared, so the program may access invalid memory
