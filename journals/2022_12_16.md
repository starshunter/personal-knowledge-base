	- ## Morning
		- 08:26 #[[Wake Time]]
		- [[Jasmine Basci]] responded to my questions #Sherlock
		- seems like I couldn't access development [[PBOB]] if I change the branch on my machine
			- the [[Pull Request]] I created was correct, so merged it #YPI/1646
			- it took some times to have the changes reflected in staging
		- [[PI/Standup]]
			- [[Clement Lee]] said I could release [[YPI/1646]] after the holiday
			- he also said I don't need to look into the bug [[MIT Team]] found, since it's working now
	- ## Afternoon
		- answered the questions [[Jasmine Basci]] asked #Sherlock
		- checked [[YPI/1646]] feature is working in staging [[PBOB]]
			- commented in the [[Jira]] ticket to ask [[Nick Moeller]] and [[Luke Salmon]] to check
