	- problem:: The K Weakest Rows in a Matrix
	  link:: https://leetcode.com/problems/the-k-weakest-rows-in-a-matrix/
	  difficulty:: Easy
	  duration:: 5 mins
	- first time solving this problem
	- count the number of ones for each row
	- store that number and row index for each row and sort them
	- take first k sorted row
	- we can use binary search to count ones, and use heap to keep track of the k weakest rows

		  title:: Synchronization
	- thread-level parallelism
	  collapsed:: true
		- divide computation among multiple threads of execution
			- independent threads compete for shared resources
			- cooperating threads communicate with each other
		- communication model
			- shared memory
			- message passing
	- synchronization
	  collapsed:: true
		- need for synchronization arises whenever there are parallel processes in a system
			- forks and joins
			- producer-consumer
			- mutual exclusion
	- thread-safe programming
	  collapsed:: true
		- multithreaded programs can be executed on a uniprocessor by timesharing
		- thread-safe multithreaded programs behave the same way regardless of whether they are executed on multiprocessors or a single processor
	- semaphores
	  collapsed:: true
		- programming construct for synchronization
		- `wait()` and `signal()` operations
		- semantic guarantee
			- the $i^{th}$ call to signal must complete before the $(i + K)^{th}$ call to wait completes, given that the semaphore is initialized to $K$
		- semaphores are themselves shared data
			- use atomic operations
			- use system calls, but only works in uniprocessors only
