		- 05:39 #[[Wake Time]]
		- [[Simon Turnbridge]] said [[YK]] staging pipeline is unstable #[[YK Data Pipeline/Consolidation]]
			- he suggested to directly release to production next week
				- may have to promote the new graph after the release
			- replacing old data pack can be done at the same time
		- [[Uni/Release]]
		- worked on [[YK Data Pipeline/Sharing]] script
	- ## Afternoon
		- [[YK Data Pipeline/Consolidation]] [[Meeting]]
			- sync on when will we release to production
			- [[Dau-Heng Hsu]] suggested to put the focus of [[YK Data Pipeline/Sharing]] on why we choose the solution
		- [[Backend Platform/Meeting]]
		- practiced [[YK Data Pipeline/Sharing]]
