# Daily Log
	- ## Midnight
		- 01:10 #[[Bed Time]]
	- ## Morning
		- 05:43 #[[Wake Time]]
		- asked [[Clement Lee]] about how to take military service leave
			- he didn't know, asked HRAnswer
			- just request on [[Workday]]
		- connection from [[PI/WS]] to [[Edlite]] kept timing out #Statslite/Migration

		- [[Uni/Taiwan Sync]]
			- [[MingMin Bai]] assigned [[Uni/5754]] to me
		- finished requesting military service leave on [[Workday]]
	- ## Afternoon
		- [[Statslite]] passes week, month, quarter id to [[Edlite]] directly
			- rewrote the [[SQL]] query to accept date
		- studied [[Uni/5754]]
			- currently, [[Uni]] will use old bucket header if there's no `APOLLOLINE=0` or `APOLLO=yes` in `GalileoVariables`
			- wrote another condition to handle this case
			- need to read the default bucket from the request
			- need to modify the [[Unit Test]]
