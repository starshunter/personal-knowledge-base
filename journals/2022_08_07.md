			- so for Sherlock, I was mainly implementing the feature requested by MIT, it's about how to handle domains that are not accessible by crawlers, and because both HLFS and SMP use crawlers to build their services, so they both may encounter some domains that forbid them from accessing, so now in this rollup page, this column will tell the user which service is unable to access the content of this domain, so for domain not accessible, it means HLFS cannot access this domain, and the users need to go into the page to review the content manually, and for image not accessible, it means SMP had trouble downloading some of the images in this domain to process them, and I put these images inside this expanded page, so the users can review each image and decide its status, if the users think this image is clean, then he can remove it, and next time if SMP found this image again, it will directly mark this image as clean image, and if the user decide that this image is not safe for work, then it will be moved to another list and included in the jira ticket to let the partner manager to handle it, so this is the feature I have been working on
			- and another things I'm studying is how to get more images out of a domain, and I already know HLFS can tell me all the links on a page, if I can correctly filter out links that take user out of this domain, like these links, then I can use these links as input data and use HLFS to crawl images from them to get more accurate result, but this is just an alternative method, because ideally, the input data MIT provides should contain this information, and they could get these information two years ago, so this is more like a backup plan in case the data is not available
			- for Sherlock, I will continue to study how to exclude unqualified links from HLFS response to get more accurate result, and after the meeting with MIT this Thursday, I should be able to know if the desired input data is available, and what method I need to use to generate the adult monitoring report, and then I will implement and optimize the script accordingly
