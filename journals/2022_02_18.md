- learn javascript event loop #JavaScript #[[Event Loop]]
	- javascript is single-threaded
	- function get pushed to the call stack when it's invoked, and popped off when they return a value
	- browsers offer web API like DOM API, HTTP request, timer and etc.
		- if functions in call stack invoke these APIs, then related callbacks will be placed inside these queue
		- the callbacks get added to the queue once the timer expires or the event response is received
	- if the call stack is empty, then event loop will pop out the first item in the queue and add it to call stack

- learn javascript hoisting #JavaScript #Hoist
	- javascript engine will setup memory allocation for the script before execution
		- functions are stored with a reference to the entire function
		- variables declared with `let` and `const` will be declared, but not initialized
		- variables declared with `var` will be declared and initialized to `undefined`
	- we can invoke function before its declaration
	- we will get `undefined` if we access a variable declared by `var` and before its declaration
	- we will get reference error if we access a variable declared by `let` or `const` and before its declaration
		- beginning of the script to its declaration is called temporal dead zone

	- problem:: Remove K Digits
	  link:: https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-k-digits/
	  difficulty:: Medium
	  duration:: 20 mins
	- third time solving this problem
	- use stack and remove digit that is bigger than its next digit
	- be careful of multiple edge cases
		- ascending digits, remove all digits, answer starting with zero and etc.
- # Afternoon
- interview with shopline #[[Job Interview]]
	- office is smaller than expected, but the atmosphere is good
	- first a 30 minutes coding test in a conference room, use hackMD, three questions
		- descriptions were unclear, and only one test case for each problem was given
		- easy level
			- fizz buzz
			- find numbers in first array that are not in second array
			- write a function that input a string, check if an alphabet is inside the string or not, return the output using bit string
	- then an interview with two engineer in another conference room, but one of them asked most of the questions
		- they asked
			- self introduction
			- what technique has I use
			- some project detail
			- what services of AWS have I use
			- how to implement a shopping cart's backend
			- do I have interest in data analysis using python
			- tell them something I recently enjoy doing
				- read books about macro economics
			- what programming languages do I familiar
			- what do I expect myself doing if I join the company
			- what is the most difficult technical problem I have solved
			- what git commands have I use
			- do I use git flow to develop
			- how do I cooperate with others using git
			- what are other companies I have applied
		- I asked
			- where do the demand come from
			- what are backend teams responsible for
			- how do they handle high traffic in a short time
			- how large is a team
			- the development flow of backend teams
			- how do they train new coworker without experience in ruby on rails
	- short talk with HR while leaving
		- she will inform me the result in one week
		- asked how many company have I applied
		- what kind of job do I want
	- a little bit serious, but overall the experience is ok
- [[The Go Workshop/Special Features]] #Golang/Reflection
	- reflection is package in go that allows program to examine and modify itself during runtime
	- `TypeOf()` and `ValueOf()`
		- syntax #Golang/Syntax
			- `func TypeOf(i interface{}) Type`
			- `func ValueOf(i interface{}) Value`
	- if the input variable is a pointer, then `ValueOf()` will return an address
		- use `Elem()` to access the value
		- we can modify the value on that address using `SetInt()`, this is only possible when we use reflection on pointer
	- use reflection to get field name, type and value
		- use `TypeOf()` or `ValueOf()` on a struct, then we can use `Field()` or `FieldByName()` to access struct fields
	- `DeepEqual()`
		- `DeepEqual()` in reflect package can be used to determine if a map or slice is equal or not
