		- study [[Docker]] on [[Pluralsight]]
			- a docker image is used to build docker container instances
			  collapsed:: true
				- image is a template to create container instance with specific file system and environment
				- container is an isolated and secured shipping container
			- an image of a VM can be very large, and docker doesn't need to contain guest OS
			- benefits of using docker
			  collapsed:: true
				- accelerate developer onboarding
				- eliminate app conflicts
					- containers are isolated
				- environment consistency
				- ship software faster
			- docker command
			  collapsed:: true
				- `docker run` and create a instance of container, use `-p` to specify the ports mapping between the host and the container
				- `docker ps` can show all the running containers, use `-a` to show all containers with different status
				- `docker rm` to remove container, `docker rmi` to remove image
				- use `docker stop` to stop a container
				- use `docker images` to show all the downloaded images
			- layered file system
			  collapsed:: true
				- the image itself is read-only, consists of layers of file system
				- we can write into the container layer
					- this layer go away once the container is removed
			- volume
			  collapsed:: true
				- a volume is a special type of directory
				- a volume can be shared and reused among containers
				- updates to an image won't affect. a volume
				- volumes are persistent
				- writing to a volume is writing to a mounted space on the host
				- use `-v` to `docker run` to create volume for a container
					- use `docker inspect` to locate the actual location of the volume on the host
					- use `-v $(host directory):$(volume)` to specify the host location of a volume
				- add `-v` to `docker rm` to remove the container and the volume
					- if you specify the volume location on the host, the command won't delete the files in that location
			- dockerfile
			  collapsed:: true
				- dockerfile can be used to build custom image
				- instructions
					- `FROM`
						- base image
					- `LABEL`
					- `RUN`

					- `COPY`
					- `ENTRYPOINT`
						- entry point to kickoff this container
					- `WORKDIR0
					- `EXPOSE`
					- `ENV`
					- `VOLUME`
				- use `docker build` to build the custom image
					- use `-t` to specify the tag for the image
					- use `-f` to specify the dockerfile
			- container linking
			  collapsed:: true
				- legacy linking
					- use `--name` to add a name to the container
					- use `--link` to link a container to another container
				- add containers to a bridge network
					- use `docker network create` to create a custom network
					- use `--net` with `docker run` to run the container in the network
					- you can use the container name to reference the container inside a container
			- docker compose
			  collapsed:: true
				- capability
				  collapsed:: true
					- start, stop and rebuild services
					- view the status of running services
					- stream the log output of running services

				- docker-compose.yml
				  collapsed:: true
					- used to build docker images and create containers
					- contents
						- version
						- services
							- specify services detail
						- services
				- commands
				  collapsed:: true
					- use `docker-compose build` to build services defined in the file
						- you can specify the service to build or rebuild
