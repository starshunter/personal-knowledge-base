# Daily Log
	- ## Midnight
		- 00:24 #[[Bed Time]]
	- ## Morning
		- 05:47 #[[Wake Time]]
		- [[Fox Wu]] approved my [[Pull Request]] #Sherlock
			- push to staging
			- upload a file to test if it can drop inaccessible domains
		- verified image and video search don't use cosmos output format using [[Splunk]]
		- created a [[Pull Request]] for [[Uni/5814]]
		- [[PI/Standup]]
		- started to add feature that allows users to upload multiple input files a month #Sherlock
	- ## Afternoon
		- the initial implementation was done, uploaded a file to test it
		- studied [[Uni/5817]]
			- the `TldBoundary` library read the file directly
			- it's a library to check domains with top level domains
			- need to use `DataHandleService` to read the file instead
			- may need to rewrite `TldBoundry` to use `DataHandleService`
