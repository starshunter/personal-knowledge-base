	- also called PB
	- $PB=\frac{market \space price \space per \space share}{book \space value \space per \space share}$
	- $book \space value \space per \space share = \frac{total \space assets - total \space liabilities}{outstanding \space shares}$
		- there are many variation of book value calculation, which one to choose depends on how conservative the investor is
	- PB can help the investors to understand whether current price is reasonable or not
	- we only use PB when PE is unavailable
		- PE can become unavailable if the earning is volatile or become negative
	- book value doesn't equal to liquidation value
		- book value normally overestimates the value of assets
	- liquidation value lower than 1 doesn't make a company a good investment
		- there must be some reasons that makes the price fall such much
		- the company may not want to liquidate, which makes the cash continually flow out and further hamper the company's liquidation value
	- the value of a company has more to do we revenue, not liquidation value
