		- [[Uni/Standup]]
		- [[Simon Turnbridge]] confirmed the problem wasn't on the enricher #[[YK Data Pipeline/Consolidation]]
			- graph before blending doesn't have specialized label
			- need to investigate why those labels were added from `wiki-zh`
		- [[Kelly Ke]] confirmed we don't need to extract Producer #[[YK Data Pipeline/Consolidation]]
			- created a [[Pull Request]] to remove this relation
	- ## Afternoon
		- recon stat confirmed specialized labels were from `wiki-zh` #[[YK Data Pipeline/Consolidation]]
			- checked recon stage's code
			- [[Simon Turnbridge]] suspected those labels didn't get deleted completely
		- asked [[Simon Turnbridge]] about extracting Company's common attributes for its subtypes #[[YK Data Pipeline/Consolidation]]
