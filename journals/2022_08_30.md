# Daily Log

	- ## Morning
		- 08:02 #[[Wake Time]]
		- gather notes for [[PI/Standup]]
			- for me, yesterday I was studying the data that Sieve stores in HBase, then I found the protocol buffer files it uses to encode each column, and one of the protocol buffer is used to encode metadata about the images in the domain, so it shows Sieve maybe has the ability to crawl the images in a domain with a specific depth, but I can't find the actual image data being stored in HBase, so I will study in this direction today and see how it actually uses the protocol buffer
		- [[PI/Standup]]
			- [[Clement Lee]] will cancel today's [[Clement Staff Meeting]]
	- ## Afternoon
		- studied [[Protocol Buffer]] that [[Sieve]] uses
			- `images` field should contain multiple url, but only saw `ogImage` in [[HBase]] query result
			- `i-i` seems to be the in-links of the url
			- `m-pil` and `m-sol` seems to be the out-links of the url, but not sure what's the difference
			- wrote a document about the study result
			- Sieve doesn't have package for
	- ## Night
		- [[Sherlock]] couldn't connect to the read-only YDS host
			- has something to do with [[ACL]]
			- it went normal after 5 hours
			- Sherlock couldn't connect one of the host in the rotation
			- asked question in the [[Slack]] channel
				- something to do with bad pod?
