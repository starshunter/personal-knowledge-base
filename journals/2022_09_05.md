		- gather notes for [[PI/Sprint Planning]]
			- so the new version of Sherlock has been deployed to staging for testing, but since then, I found some issues need to be resolved, the first issue is about the crawling job of adult monitoring, so Sherlock needs to use HLFS to crawl the domains, but the requests Sherlock sent to HLFS returns lots of politeness error that I haven't seen when testing on my machine, it's because some domains Sherlock needs to crawl enforce a politeness policy, and HLFS was blocked by those domains because the requests sent from Sherlock violate that policy, I think it's because Sherlock crawl the domain too frequent, and the domain owner wants to avoid this behavior to protect their server load, so they block HLFS from accessing temporarily, so to solve this issue, I have changed the way Sherlock crawls a domain, and increase the time interval  between each requests to respect the politeness policy, and I will try crawling domains again this week to see how the new method does, and another issue is the YDS connection issue, so from last Tuesday to Friday, Sherlock was unable to connect to one of the YDS host, and because of this, staging Sherlock was unavailable to the users during that time period, and according to YDS team, the issue happened because Sherlock is connecting to production YDS hosts from Omega crop cluster, and this cross zones connection shouldn't be allowed, so although the connection is working well now, I am planning to move Sherlock to production cluster to avoid this connection from happening again in the future
			- for Sherlock, to fix the YDS connection issue, I already applied for new colo for the Omega namespace, and also applied for new PES roles for YDS, and once these requested are approved, I can started to deploy Sherlock and test it on the new cluster

			- [[Chih-Yu Ko]] mentioned users may not be able to file [[Jira]] ticket from [[Omega]] prod cluster
	- ## Afternoon

			- rewrote `screwdriver.yaml` and `omega.yaml`
		- studied [[Brooklyn]] #Sherlock
			- may need to setup another rotation
		- studied [[Jira]] API #Sherlock
			- accessing from [[Omega]] prod cluster need to open [[ACL]]
			- not sure how to do it
