			- haneo was appointed to defend a man who downloaded movie from the Internet
			- he uploaded edited movie to his youtube channel
			- he didn't think he was wrong
			- the movie company didn't accept a settlement
			- yamada didn't follow haneo's plan on the court
			- a famous director was mistaken as defendant
			- haneo noticed there're cuts in the video that didn't appear in the movie
			- the director said it was uploaded by one of the assistance
			- haneo convinced the defendant to plead guilty
			- the director didn't accept the defendant's apology

	- ## Morning
		- 08:18 #[[Wake Time]]
		- forbade user to upload input data for current month #Sherlock
		- gather notes for [[PI/Standup]]
			- for Sherlock, yesterday I finished rewriting some APIs to update data in the database, and since the feature of handling inaccessible domains and images is basically finished, I will start to explore the alternatives of crawling domains if MIT cannot get the input data I need, so I will study what HLFS is capable to do, and how can I use it to crawl more images out of a domain to get more accurate result
		- [[PI/Standup]]
		- the production [[Omega]] namespace of [[Sherlock]] is `search--platform-camelot-k8s`, colo is `omega.prod1.corp.bf1` #Sherlock #Kubernetes
			- run `kubectl config use-context omega.prod1.corp.bf1` to specify cluster
			- run `kubectl config set-context omega.prod1.corp.bf1 --namespace search--platform-camelot-k8s` to specify namespace
				- or `kubectl config set contexts.omega.prod1.corp.bf1.namespace search--platform-camelot-k8s`
		- run `kubectl create -f create_pvc.yaml` to create pvc #Omega #Kubernetes
			- run `kubectl get pvc -n search--platform-camelot-k8s` to verify
	- ## Afternoon
		- changed environment variables for each kind of environment #Sherlock
		- studied how [[HLFS]] can get all the links on a page #Sherlock
			- use `DocInfo` request option
			- it also has the type of each link, but the type doesn't help me to identify links in the same domain
			- there may be duplicated link, so filtering is necessary
		- two phases to crawl images one level down the domain page #Sherlock
			- first phase get all the links in domain pages
			- second phase crawl all the images in those links
	- ## Night
		- thought about how to comply to [[HLFS]]'s rps requirement #Sherlock
			- adding another level of callback cannot guarantee the time interval between each request
			- for a domain, wait till first phase is finished, then the second phase can proceed with the time interval
			- or just wait until all the domains finish their first phase, then start executing second phase
				- hard to recover from interruption
