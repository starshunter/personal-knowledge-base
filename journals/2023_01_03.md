# Daily Log
	- ## Midnight
		- 01:50 #[[Bed Time]]
	- ## Morning
		- 08:32 #[[Wake Time]]
		- implemented the request from [[Laura Calverley]] #Uni
			- added a new request parameter `adRemoveTextAds`
			- removed `TextAds` from `adTypesFilter` when it's set
		- [[PI/Sprint Planning]]
		- cannot access [[PBob]] staging to verify [[YPI/1646]] status #PBob
	- ## Afternoon
		- tested the built package of [[Uni]]
			- the changes worked
			- [[Slack]] [[Laura Calverley]] about the host and how to use it
		- [[Clement Staff Meeting]]
		- read about [[Java/Spring Framework]] #Statslite/Migration
			- found out what classes are responsible for handling the request
				- controllers
			- learned about aspect-oriented programming
				- why there are logs before and after entering a method
			- still need to clarify how a request is caught, and how the servlet container is started
