			- a git projects store data in four areas
			  collapsed:: true
				- working area
					- current files and folders
				- repository
					- history
					- inside `.git/objects`
					- objects are immutable
					- branch is a reference to a commit
					- there can only be one `HEAD`, which typically points to a branch
				- index
					- files before commit
					- another place to hold the data
					- if we have nothing to commit, think of the index and the repository have the same data
						- use `git diff --cached` to check the difference
				- stash
					- temporary storage
			- two questions to ask before using a command
				- how does a command move information across the areas
				- how does the command change the repository
			- `git add` move the changed files into the index
			- `git commit` move the changed files  into the repository, it also creates commit object
			- `git checkout` can move `HEAD` reference, and copy data from the newest commit to the working area and the index
			- `git rm` will remove the file from the working directory and the index
				- add `--cached` to remove it only from the index
			- git can find out which file has been renamed or moved automatically
			- `git reset` moves the current branch to a specific commit
				- `--hard` moves the data from current commit to both the working area and the index
				- `--mixed` moves the to the index
				- `--soft` won't copy any data
			- `git stash` can store the files in the working area and index that are not in the current commit, into the stash
				- it also checkouts the current commit
				- we can have multiple elements in the stash
				- `--include-untracked` can also take the untracked files in the working area, and store them into stash
				- use `git stash list` to read the contents in the stash
				- use `git stash apply` to bring the data in the stash back
			- `git merge` creates a few new objects in the `.git` directory
				- they will not go away until we finish the merge
			- we can specify the changed file we want to remove from the index by using `git reset HEAD <file_name>`
			- we can specify the changed file we want to remove from the index and the working directory by using `git checkout HEAD <file_name>`
			- we can use `git add <file_name> --patch` to add changes line by line into the index
			- `git show` can show the details of a commit
				- `git show HEAD^` show the previous commit
				- `git show HEAD~2` show the second last commit
			- `git diff` can show the difference between two commits
			- never change shared commits
			- use `git commit --amend` to modify the current commit
				- it doesn't actually change the commit, it creates a new commit with the changes we want, and move the branch to it
			- `git reflog` will show every reference change action
			- `git revert` can create a new commit that revert the changes of past commits
