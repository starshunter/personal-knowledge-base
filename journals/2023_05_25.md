		- 05:43 #[[Wake Time]]
		- [[Uni/Taiwan Sync]]
			- updated on [[Uni/5885]]
				- need run [[Performance Test]] agains my [[QA]] host
		- [[PI/Standup]]
		- wrote [[Unit Test]] for [[Uni/5885]]
			- need to make sure we don't actually send event through socket
				- created a dummy service
			- need to check if any socket is created during runtime
				- use [[GMock]] to mock a function
			- need to simulate multi-thread scenario
	- ## Afternoon
		- updated [[Uni/5788]] [[Pull Request]]
		- ran [[Performance Test]] for [[Uni/5885]]
			- when maximum users is 100, the new implementation was slightly worse starting from 90 percentile
			- when maximum users is 50, the control case response time increase substantially, need to rerun later
