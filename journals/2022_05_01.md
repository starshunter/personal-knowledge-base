- learn about [[Local Class]] in [[Java]]
  collapsed:: true
	- local class is a special kind of [[Inner Class]]
	- we can declare a local class inside any block
	- access
	  id:: 626d7036-f087-4cc9-8624-1ecf9ccd49da
		- a local class can access to the members of its enclosing class
			- if it is declared in a static method, then it can only access enclosing class's static member
		- a local class can access to local variables, it the variables are final or effectively final
			- it captures the variable, it creates a copy of that value
				- if the local variables change, we cannot guarantee the change can be seen by the local class
				- if the method exists, but a inner class instance still exists in the heap, that instance should be able to know the value of local variables
		- a local class can access to the method's parameters, if the parameters are final or effectively final
	- static
	  id:: 626d7040-0d7d-47c6-873d-169abc836029
		- local classes are non-static because they can access instance members of the enclosing block
		- we cannot declare static initializer or member interfaces in a local class
		- we can declare static members if they are constant variables
		- we cannot declare an interface inside a block
			- interfaces are inherently static

  collapsed:: true
	- a nurse was killed, and shimura woke up beside the dead body
	- it was kiriko that brought shimura to the crime scene
	- kiriko proposed a plan to catch the killer, so the police pretend to arrest shimura
	- kiriko told the police where and when the next crime would occur
	- the police failed to catch the killer
	- shimura recalled a smell he notice at the crime scene
	- kiriko told him it was the smell of a drug, and they went to meet a drug dealer to get the customer list
	- shimura went to the killer place and caught him
	- it was the president of a hospital commission the killer to kill two people to cover up his scandal
	- the killer produced knives for other criminals, but there wasn't the knife shimura wanted to find in his house
- [[麻煩一族/EP2]]
  collapsed:: true
	- sato asked kenta's grandmother for forgiveness, who gave her rigorous training
	- sato learned every man in miyama family has a mistress
	- because sato used the bread, kumi couldn't make the soup keiichi wanted
	- keiichi said kumi couldn't compare to aya
	- izumi became kenta's secretary
	- sato went to buy a dress, and met aya on the way back
	- aya knew sato didn't like her, so she spilled her drink onto sato
	- aya came to kenta's party and picked fault with kumi
	- sato reprimanded her and asked her to leave
	- izumi came to the party wearing the same dress as sato's
	- she apologized to sato and left
	- kento walked her to the taxi

- learn about [[Anonymous Class]] in [[Java]]
  collapsed:: true
	- anonymous classes are just like [[Local Class]], except that they don't have names, and they only be used once
	- the syntax of anonymous class expression is like the invocation of a constructor, except that there is a class definition contained in a block of code
		- ```java
		  HelloWorld frenchGreeting = new HelloWorld() {
		    String name = "tout le monde";
		    public void greet() {
		      greetSomeone("tout le monde");
		    }
		    public void greetSomeone(String someone) {
		      name = someone;
		      System.out.println("Salut " + name);
		    }
		  };
		  ```
	- anonymous classes must extend another class or implement an interface
	- anonymous class has the same access level as [local class does](((626d7036-f087-4cc9-8624-1ecf9ccd49da)))
	- anonymous class has the same static members restrictions as [local class does](((626d7040-0d7d-47c6-873d-169abc836029)))
	- anonymous class cannot have constructors
		- it can have instance initializers
# Afternoon
- learn about [[Lambda Expression]] in [[Java]]
  collapsed:: true
	- syntax
	  collapsed:: true
		- a comma-separated list of parameters enclosed in parentheses
			- ```java
			  (a, b) -> a + b;
			  ```
			- we can omit the data type of the parameters
			- we can omit the parentheses if there is only one parameter
		- the arrow token `->`
		- a body containing a single expression or a statement block
			- if it contains a single statement, then Java runtime will evaluate that statement and return it
			- if it contains a statement block, then we must enclose that block using braces
				- a return statement is not an expression
	- access level
	  collapsed:: true
		- lambda expressions can capture local variables or parameters of the enclosing scope, but they cannot shadow them
			- they don't create another scope; they are considered to be at the same scope at their enclosing scope
			- if we declare a parameter of a lambda expression to have the same name as a local variable of enclosing scope, the compiler will generate an error
			- lambda expressions can access them, if they are final, or effectively final
		- lambda expressions can access the fields and methods of the enclosing scope
	- target typing
	  collapsed:: true
		- Java compiler uses the target type of the context or situation in which the lambda expression was found
		- which means we can only use lambda expressions in situations in which the Java compiler can determine a target type
	- use cases
	  collapsed:: true
		- because Java is an object-oriented language, we if we want to pass a function as an argument, we must define a class with that method, then instantiate it, and pass it to the function
		- to simplify this procedure, we can define an interface we an abstract method we want to use, then pass an anonymous class as argument, which implement that interface
		- an interface with only one abstract method is called [[Functional Interface]]
		- in we need to pass an instance of a [[Functional Interface]], we can pass a [[Lambda Expression]] that satisfy the abstract method's requirements
			- parameter list and return type
		- Java has some standard function interfaces for our use
			- instead of defining our own functional interface, we can use the standard functional interface directly
		- to summarize, [[Functional Interface]] allows us to use [[Lambda Expression]], and [[Lambda Expression]] allows us to avoid clumsy code
	- [[Method Reference]]
	  collapsed:: true
		- method reference is a special kind of lambda expression
		- suppose that a lambda expression only invoke a method, then we can call the method directly
		- different kind of method reference
			- reference to a static method
				- `ContainingClass::staticMethodName`
			- reference to an instance method of a particular object
				- `containingObject::instanceMethodName`
			- reference to an instance method of an arbitrary object of a particular type
				- `ContainingType::methodName`
			- reference to a constructor
				- `ClassName::new`
	- references
