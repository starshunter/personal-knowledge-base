			- [[User Location]] returned 401 unauthorized
			- couldn't get [[CKMS]] key for [[Isotope]]
			- [[VMBridge]] is working fine
	- ## Afternoon
		- tried to debug my [[Istio]] configuration
			- can't find [[Uni]] when using `PERMISSIVE_MTLS`
			- still find the same error when changing to the same settings as image [[MTLS]]
			- no outbound traffic log in [[Istio]] [[Envoy]] log
				- only services response have log
			- the 401 error for [[User Location]] and [[[Unified Geo]] might be caused by the mismatch of [[Certificate]] and the endpoint
