		- [[PI/Sprint Planning]]
	- ## Afternoon
		- [[Fox Wu]] said I can push the change I made on [[PI/Dashboard]]
			- told [[Leon Ku]] about this
			- pushed to staging first, then push to production
			- [[Leon Ku]] added me to a slack channel for discussing [[PI]]
		- tried to run the script again #Sherlock
			- [[HLFS]] and [[Insight API]] were not working
			- [[HLFS]] returned 403 error occasionally
				- used production endpoint instead
			- still no clue about [[Insight API]]
	- ## Night
		- found the dashboard monitoring [[Insight API]] traffic #Sherlock
			- it showed all the request are getting error recently
		- responded to [[Amar Kamat]]'s questions in [[Slack]] #Sherlock
			- tried to confirm the error I got is a timed out error
