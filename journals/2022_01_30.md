	- turn after turn after turn after turn after...
	- really like how the writer lay out the story, instead of one episode one case, focusing on details of cases make this drama so much interesting
	- although the murderer was found, intension of the victim remained unknown

	- problem:: Rotate Array
	  link:: https://leetcode.com/problems/rotate-array/
	  difficulty:: Medium
	  duration:: 2hrs
	  id:: 6251720c-7ca7-474e-a28e-6d33967ab2c2
	- third time solving this problem
	- wanted to solve it by continually swapping individual element onto the right position, but fail to construct the solution
		- the argument is that, if start + 1 is reachable from start, than so is start + 2, start + 3..., thus we can keep a counter for how many element we have rotate, and don't need to worry we shift an element more than one time
	- swap first k elements with last k element, than update starting point and k

	- what's Internet
		- nuts and bolts view
			- devices (end systems), links (connect end systems and switches) and packet switches (forward packets)
			- network of networks, protocols, standards
		- service view
			- infrastructure for applications
			- provides APIs
	- what's protocol
		- [a set of rules that governs the exchange of messages between communicating parties](((61f69209-8e95-4d8b-9b51-fc932e7c63da)))
	- network structure
		- network edge

		- routing
		  id:: 61fd06fb-35c9-45f8-8396-44af2acfe09c
			- determines the route to take a packet to its destination
			  id:: 61fd06fb-95db-48c9-a478-6e6fcd500fa6
		- forwarding
		  id:: 61fd06fb-20b9-460c-8212-b0429b466864
			- move a packet from router's input to correct output
			  id:: 61fd06fb-f75c-4e72-8cfb-8de2834a0525
		- packet switching
			- entire packet must arrive at router before it can be transmitted
			- it take L/R seconds to transmit a packet of L bit onto a link of R transmission rate
			- if arrival rate exceeds transmission rate packet will queue, or eventually begin dropped
		- packet switching vs. circuit switching
			- circuit switching reserves dedicated resources for each link, causing low resource utilization
			- packet switching allows more users to use network, and no need to preliminary setup
			- yet packet switching may encounter packet loss, so reliable data transfer is needed
	- sources of packet delay
		- processing delay
			- error check, determine output link
		- queueing delay
			- depending on level of congestion
			- ((61f6a8f6-0bee-4cfb-8621-fcf9dcee531b))
		- transmission delay
			- L/R
		- propagation delay
			- length of physical link/propagation speed in medium
	- throughput
		- rate at which bits transferred between sender and receiver
		- bottleneck link refers to the link on end-end path that constrains end-end throughput
	- protocol reference model
		- communication functions are complex nowadays
		- layered approach has been widely adopted
		- ==it describes the function of the layers and the relations of the layers==
	- OSI seven-layer protocol reference model
		- ((61f6ac7b-9edf-4b1b-9464-20665775a513))
