# Daily Log
	- ## Midnight
		- 00:00 #[[Bed Time]]
	- ## Morning
		- 05:43 #[[Wake Time]]
		- can connect [[PI/Database]] staging through [[SQL]] developer, but middleware still seems to have connection issue #YPI/1660 #PBob
			- the `getUserRole` request timeout
			- [[PI/Middleware]] can't connect to [[PI/Database]] staging
			- asked [[Vincent Chuang]] about this
				- he suggested to restart the [[PI/Middleware]]
				- the issue persisted after restarting
		- [[Uni/Meeting]]
			- got assigned to [[Uni/5814]]
		- [[PI/Standup]]
			- [[Clement Lee]] mentioned there was an incident about [[Uni/5714]], caused by [[SFE]] hardcoded the source tag in the request
				- talked about the communication process
	- ## Afternoon
		- looked into [[Uni/5814]]
			- there's a [[Pull Request]] for sending `rguid` to [[SFE]] for web search traffic
				- it parsed `rguid` from a header
			- there's no `rguid` header in image and video search
				- only `ImpressionFeedbackUrl` got `rguid`
		- [[Meeting]] with [[Vincent Chuang]] and [[Jack Chiang]] to discuss #YPI/1660
			- [[PI/Database]] was still broken
			- [[Jack Chiang]] suggested to use [[VIncent Chuang]]'s dev box for testing
			- confirmed again what to do on my side
		- [[Ares Huang]] asked to talk with me about the [[Uni/5714]] incident tomorrow after [[PI/Standup]]
		- used [[Vincent Chuang]] dev box to do the integration #YPI/1660 #PBob
			- need to modify the middleware url when reading it from settings
			- I can log into [[PI]]
			- there's one request that success, but with an empty response
				- the log in the dev box suggested that the request lack of `Accept-Encoding` header
				- the issue persisted even after adding the header
			- reset the changes, still getting empty resposne
