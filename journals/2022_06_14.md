		- learn [[Kubernetes]] on [[Pluralsight]]
			- pods
			  collapsed:: true
				- a pod is the basic execution unit of Kubernetes application, the smallest and simplest unit in the Kubernetes object model that you create or deploy
				- a pod is the environment for containers
				- a pod has IP, memory, volumes and they are shared across containers
				- pods live and die but never come back to life
				- pods don't span nodes
				- use `kubectl run [pod name] --image=[image name]` to create a new pod
				- pods and containers are only accessible within the Kubernetes cluster by default
					- use `kubectl port-forward [pod name] [port mapping]` to expose container port
				- use `kubectl delete pod [pod name]` to delete the pod
					- a new pod will be recreated
					- use `kubectl delete deployment [deployment name]` to delete the deployment
				- use `kubectl create -f [file name]` to create a pod using YAML
				- use `kubectl apply -f [file name]` to apply changes to a pod from YAML
					- add `--save-config` to `kubectl create` at the first place
				- Kubernetes uses probes to determine the health of a pod container
				  collapsed:: true
					- two types of probes
						- liveness
							- the pod is healthy or not
						- readiness
							- the pod should receive requests or not
					- failed containers are recreated by default
					- we can define the probes in the YAML file
			- deployment
			  collapsed:: true
				- if a pod failed, it cannot come back alive
				- a replicaset is a declarative way to manage pods
				- a deployment is a declarative way to manage pods using replicaset
				- replicasets act as a pod controllers
					- self healing
					- ensure the requested number of pods are available
					- fault tolerance
					- scale pods
					- relies on a pod template
				- a deployment manages pods
					- use replicasets to manage pods
					- scale replicasets
					- support zero downtime
					- rollback functionality
					- create a unique label that is assigned to the replicasets and generated pods
				- use `kubesctl create` or `kubectl apply` to create a new deployment
				- use `kubectl scale [deployment name] --replicas` to scale the deployment
				- kubernetes allows zero downtime deployment
					- the deployment creates a new replicaset to create new pods
					- it keeps the old pods alive until all the new pods are available
			- service
			  collapsed:: true
				- a service provides a single point of entry for accessing one or more pods
					- we cannot rely on the IP address of a pod, because pods can live and die
					- services abstract pod IP addresses from consumers
					- it provides load balancing between pods
					- it relies on labels to associate a service with a pod
				- service types
					- ClusterIP
						- service ip is exposed internally within the cluster
						- allows pods to talk to other pods
					- NodePort
						- exposes the service on each node's ip at a static port
					- LoadBalancer
						- exposes a service externally
					- ExternalName
						- acts as an alias for an external service
						- allows a service to act as the proxy for an external service
			- storage
			  collapsed:: true
				- volumes can be used to hold data and state for pods and containers
				- a pod can have multiple volumes attached to it
				- containers rely on a mountPath to access a volume
				- a volume references a storage location
				- a volume mount references a volume by name and defines a mountPath
				- volume types
				  collapsed:: true
					- emptyDir
						- has lifetime of the pod
					- hostPath
						- mount to volume on a worker node
					- nfs
					- configMap/secret
					- persistentVolume
						- a persistentVolume is a cluster wide storage unit provisioned by an administrator with a lifecycle independent from a pod
							- available to a pod even it gets rescheduled to a different node
						- a persistentVolumeClaim is a request for a storage unit
						- rely on a storage provider such as NSF, cloud or other options
				- storageClass
				  collapsed:: true
					- a type of storage template that can be used to dynamically provision storage
						- administrators don't have to create PVs in advance
					- used to define different classes of storage
			- configMaps and secrets
				- configMap provides a way to inject configuration data into a container
				- can store entire files or provide key/value pairs
				- created through YAML file or env file
				- load a configMap in the YAML file
				- a secret is an object that contains a small amount of sensitive data such as a password, a token or a key
				- Kubernetes mounts secrets into pods as files or as environment variables
				- Kubernetes only makes secrets available to nodes that have a pod requesting the secret
				- we can create secrets through `kubectl`
					- the secret is stored in manifest file with base64 encoded
				- access secret through YAML file just like configMap
		- gather notes for [[PI/Standup]]
		  collapsed:: true
			- yesterday, I planned to study how to use persistent storage on Omega to allow my script to preserve its data across pod restarts, but I found it hard to understand the document because I lacked experience in kubernetes, so I plan to study the basic of kubernetes first, understand how its persistent storage works, and I will compare using persistent storage as a solution, with using table in the database as another solution to determine which solution suits my use case
		- [[PI/Standup]]

	- ## Afternoon
		- [[SDT Cloud Migration]]
		- [[Clement Staff Meeting]]
