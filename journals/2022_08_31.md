		- both hosts of [[YDS]] become unable to connect #Sherlock
		- told [[Fox Wu]] about the issue I had about [[YDS]] #Sherlock
			- he asked more questions in [[Slack]]
		- gather notes for [[PI/Standup]]
			- for me, yesterday I found out that sherlock in staging failed to connect to one of the YDS host, so sherlock is not accessible to the users, and I was trying to figure out what went wrong, and asked some questions in slack, but cannot resolve this problem, so Fox is helping me on this issue, and we are waiting for further response from YDS team
		- [[PI/Standup]]
