	- cross-site scripting
	- hacker choose a victim site and inject malicious script into it, then send it to user to complete attack
	- reflected XSS
		- injected script is normally in the url, and since client's browser will trust the response of a trusted site, the script will be executed
	- stored XSS
		- the injected script is stored permanently in the database of the targeted site
	- DOM based XSS
		- malicious script is injected into DOM
		- the site itself probably modify the DOM bases on user input
	- prevention
		- add filter at server side
		- encode user input before writing it into HTML
		- user input sanitization

- learn database normalization #[[Database/Normalization]]
	- why do we need database normalization
		- to reduce data redundancy in the database
		- two different but related data store in the same table
	- data redundancy may cause insertion or update anomaly
		- insert more redundant data
		- update need to be carefully handled, otherwise may cause data inconsistence
	- 1st normal form
		- every column should contain atomic value
		- every value of the same column should have the same type
		- each column should have unique name
		- the order of the entry does not matter
	- 2nd normal form
		- table is in 1st normal form and does not have partial dependency
		- partial dependency means a non primary attribute is partially dependent on a subset of candidate keys
		- super key
			- a key composes of a set of attributes that can uniquely identify a record
		- candidate key
			- a key composes of a set of attributes that can uniquely identify a record, and delete any attribute of the key will let the key fail to identify unique record
	- 3rd normal form
		- table is in 2nd normal form and does not have transitive dependency
		- transitive dependency
			- a non primary attribute is dependent on another non primary attribute, which is dependent on primary key
	- BCNF
		- table is in 3rd normal form and for every dependency A -> B in the table, A should be the table's super key

- learn JWT
	- why JWT
		- if our server is an API-based server, then we cannot use cookie - session type authorization
		- instead of creating a session for each user, we can store user related data in the token
		- if there are multiple server, then we don't need to worry some servers don't have certain user session using JWT
	- JWT structure
		- header
			- token type
			- hashing algorithm
		- payload
			- JSON data
		- verify signature
			- use the algorithm defined in the header to hash header, payload and a secret key into a signature, and attach this signature to JWT
			- as long as the secret key is secured, then server can trust the information carry by JWT
