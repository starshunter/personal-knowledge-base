		- 07:29 #[[Wake Time]]
		- [[Shruthi Shyamala]] canceled the [[Meeting]] about discussing [[Uni/5884]] requirements and related questions
			- she will have a [[Meeting]] with [[Microsoft]] next week
			- it's rescheduled to [[Aug 3rd, 2023]]
		- [[Uni/Taiwan Sync]]
		- [[Shruthi Shyamala]] wanted more detailed explanation about the blockers I'm facing
			- created a document to explain the problems and high level
		- [[TW Backend/Standup]]
	- ## Afternoon
		- tested the difference of using image insights token and image url #Uni/5884
			- insights tokens usually return more modules in the response
			- the insights tokens returned in the image search response are not necessary valid
			- sometimes the image tokens in image search response and image insights response are different
			- TODO need to call the insights API through [[QA]] host to confirm it's not caused by calling the API directly
		- [[Allen Hsieh]] asked about how to update [[Oozie]] job #Sherlock
			- [[MIT Team]] has reported the number of low [[TQ Score]] violations is lower than expected
