		- gather notes for [[PI/Sprint Planning]]
			- for Sherlock, in the last meeting with MIT, they reviewed the image scores produced by version 4 model, they tried to set the threshold to 0.9, but there are still too many false positive, so they would like to try using both version 3 and version 4 models together, and I implemented this change last sprint and test it in my dev environment, so after my PR for changing the DB schema is merged, I will deploy it to staging
			- for uni credit card ad, I verified the position value with PM, and she confirmed it will be a new value, so I created a new ad region in uni for monitoring the ads in this region and also for producing output, and I also clarify some questions about the api response I had previously, so after discussing with the frontend engineer, we were able to agree on the output format which uni will send to search frontend
			- for Sherlock, after pushing to staging, I will let the script to produce the result, and then send it to MIT to let them verify the result is what they want
			- for Uni, I have implemented what the task requested, so next I will wait for MSFT to enable credit card ad in the bucket, and then use my QA machine to do further testing
		- [[PI/Sprint Planning]]
	- ## Afternoon
		- labeled the images crawled by [[HLFS]] with personal judgement #Sherlock
			- used criteria set by [[Trending Now]]
		- found some weird sequence where multiple images have the same score, but they are definitely different images #Sherlock
			- tried to find the bug
			- need to use [[Insight API]] to score the images again
			- scores come in an array, and the order may be different
