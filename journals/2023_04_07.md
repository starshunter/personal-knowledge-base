- # Daily Log
	- ## Midnight
		- 00:15 #[[Bed Time]]
	- ## Morning
		- 05:44 #[[Wake Time]]
		- [[Uni/Standup]]
		- studied [[Oozie]] #Sherlock
			- learned how a workflow is executed
			- learned the relation between workflow and coordinator
				- workflow is a series of actions on the [[Yahoo Grid]]
				- coordinator is a job to execute a workflow periodically
			- learned how to configure a workflow
	- ## Afternoon
		- studied how to implement low [[TQ Score]] violation type #Sherlock
			- ad unit id seems to be what [[Microsoft]] is using as the counter part of [[Source Tag]]
				- they should be one-on-one mapping
			- there's only device id in [[Apollo]] databases, need to get the device name elsewhere
				- or don't need to, just specify the desktop id?
			- a simple select, join, aggregate [[Hive]] query could get the result
