- [[亂來!我居然會成為社長/EP2]]
	- slightly better than last episode
	- female lead dump 80% of her work to man lead
	- the french restaurant opened successfully, but the sales was pretty bad
	- man lead felt guilty of himself, because he made a mistake on the flyers
	- female lead took no responsibility of the result, because she had no idea how to run a company
	- but she accidentally found a mother and a son, invited them to the restaurant
	- this incident inspired man lead to focus their target customer on parent and child on weekend
	- the sales indeed are better now
- [[妻子變成小學生/EP1]]
	- definitely no.1 of the season so far
	- performance of major roles are really well
	- though probably will be a sad ending, still looking forward to story development

- [[LeetCode Daily Challenge/2022-01]] #String #DFS #Design #Trie
	- problem:: Design Add and Search Words Data Structure
	  link:: https://leetcode.com/problems/design-add-and-search-words-data-structure/
	  difficulty:: Medium
	  duration:: 30 mins
	  id:: 61f542da-5b7e-462d-bbfa-6ea9a547157b
	- third time solving this problem, not that hard
	- implement trie solution right away
	- stuck at how to initialize a member vector and a member class pointer for a while
		- need to look into initializer list later
	- should  implement search function with recursive method, forget I forget about it, so it delayed my completion time
- # Night
- how to use c++ initializer list? #C++ #[[Initializer List]]
  id:: 61f542da-ef5a-4cb3-9690-e635d3dde586
	- when to use
		- initialize non-static constant data member
		- initialize reference data member
		- initialize object that doesn't have default constructor
			- there's a constructor with parameters but no default constructor
		- initialize base class member
		- when constructor's parameter has the same name as data member
		- performance
	- refer to [this](https://vinesmsuic.github.io/2020/01/09/c++-initializationlists/#從performance角度) article
- [[The Go Workshop/Functions]] #Golang/Functions
	- functions in go can return multiple values
	- function can be the parameter or return value of another function
	- function
		- syntax #Golang/Syntax
			- `func add(i, j int) int`
			- `<name>(<param 1>, <param 2>, ...)`
			- `<value 1>, <value 2>,... := <name>()`
		- function signature means the combination of parameters and return values
		- use `_` to ignore return value
		- naked returns
			- if you add names to return values, than you can use those as local variable, and even left blank after `return` statement, which is called naked blank
			- don't use naked return in a large function, it damage the readability of code and may cause shadowing
	- variadic function
		- variadic function is a kind of function that can accept variable number of parameter
		- syntax #Golang/Syntax
			- `func <name>(<param> ...<type>)`
		- `...` is the pack operator
		- the arguments pass into function will be packed into slice
		- a function can only allow one pack operator, and it has to be placed at the end
		- use unpack operator to pass a slice's elements into variadic function
	- anonymous functions and closure
		- function without identifier
		- syntax #Golang/Syntax
			- ```golang
			  func(<param> <type>) {
			  	
			  }(<arg>)
			  ```
			- ```golang
			  f := func() {
			  
			  }
			  f()
			  ```
		- we can use anonymous function to create colsure
			- closure can use variables in parent scope even after leaving that scope
	- parameter with function type
		- function is also a type in go
		- function signature needs to match if you wish to pass function as argument
			- the same applies to using function as return value
	- defer
		- add `defer` to the beginning of a function will delay its execution after parent function finish executing
		- `defer` can also applies to anonymous function
		- normally used to release resources, closes files or connections
		- if there're multiple `defer` in a function, than those functions being deferred will follow FILO rule
		- deferred function will capture values, not the variables that passed to it
			- but anonymous function with closure will not be affected
