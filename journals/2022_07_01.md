		- gather notes for [[PI/Standup]]
			- for Sherlock, yesterday I finished changing all the related SQL queries to use one fact table, and I also worked on the exclusion list feature, I tried to let the user to be able to specify multiple referrer domains in one exclusion rule, but I'm stuck at the SQL query now, I cannot get it to work both on adult monitoring and search policy violations at the same time, so I plan to do some experiments with smaller data first to figure out the correct SQL query
		- found a bug in production #Sherlock
			- when using `ALL` as violation type in exclusion list, it cannot correct exclude that violation
			- if I fix it, it may result in duplicate records
				- `LEFT OUTER JOIN` will produce multiple records if there are multiple matches
			- told [[Fox Wu]] about this, he thought it's a bug
	- ## Afternoon
		- wrote new query to correctly exclude violations #Sherlock
	- ## Night
