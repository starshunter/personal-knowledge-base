		- 05:44 #[[Wake Time]]
		- [[Uni/Standup]]
			- asked how to test [[Uni/5817]]
				- [[Mingmin Bai]] said I could just check the log
		- [[AMA]] with [[Uma Ramanan]]
		- started sending some requests to [[QA]] host to test [[Uni/5817]]
			- looked good, can retrieve data handle, and the result was correct
		- [[PI/Standup]]
			- next [[Scrum]] master will be [[Archie Yang]]
		- [[Jack Chiang]] confirmed the formula to calculate the weighted [[TQ Score]] is on [[GitHub Enterprise]] wiki
		- [[Nick Moeller]] wanted to change the [[UI]] title of market classification #YPI/1660 #PBob
			- tested with [[Vincent Chuang]]'s dev box
			- created a [[Pull Request]] and [[Jack Chiang]] approved it
	- ## Afternoon
		- started cleaning up code for [[Uni/5817]]
			- created the [[Pull Request]]
		- investigated the relation between tiny image size and inaccessible images by [[Insight API]] #Sherlock
			- not strongly related
			- can still filter out tiny image, since they can't be adult image with that size
