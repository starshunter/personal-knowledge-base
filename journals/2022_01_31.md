	- heap vs. priority queue
		- priority queue is an abstract data type
		- a heap is data structure
		- heap is a way to implement priority queue, and it can guarantee both insert and delete operation with time complexity $O(log N)$
		- TODO need to clarify the difference between ADT and DS
	- heap
		- a complete binary tree
		- the value of each not must not be greater/less than its child nodes
		- after insertion or deletion, the above properties should remain unaffected
		- an example implementation

	- binary tree to array
		- suppose we give root a index 1
		- than for any node $n$ beside root, its parent is $n/2$
		- for any node $n$, its children are $2 * n$ and $2 * n + 1$
		- to check a node is leaf or not, we can check if it's greater than $TreeSize / 2$

	- two type of network application architectures
		- client-server
			- sever has permanent IP address
			- clients communicate with server, but not with each other
		- p2p
			- no always-on server
			- arbitrary end systems communicate directly
			- client create demand and offer service at the same time
	- processes communication
		- processes in different hosts communicate by exchanging messages
		- process sends/receives messages to/from its socket
			- socket than use services provided by transport layer to transfer the message
		- socket use IP and port number as identifier
	- application layer protocol
		- define
			- type of message
			- message syntax
			- message semantics
			- when and how to send and respond
		- essential services
			- data integrity
			- timing
			- throughput
			- security
		- underlying transport protocols
			- depending on application's essential, may use different transport protocol
			- TCP and UDP
				- no encryption
			- SSL and TLS
				- provides encrypted TCP connection
	- web application
		- web page contains different objects
			- on base HTML reference to other objects
		- web use HTTP as application layer protocol
			- client-server model
			- use TCP at port 80
			- stateless
		- HTTP may be persistent or non-persistent
			- only one object can be sent or multiple objects
			- non-persistent HTTP must open a connection for each objects

		- caches
			- ((61f8a4f3-95b8-45f8-b447-6091d17f5375))
			- satisfy request without involving origin server
				- browser send requests to proxy server, if required object is in cache than return, otherwise the proxy server request the object from original server
				- reduce response time
				- reduce traffic
			- cache acts as both client and server
			- use conditional GET to see if required object in cache is out dated or not
	- FTP
		- use for file transfer
		- FTP server is on port 21
		- use TCP
		- stateful
	- electronic mail
		- user agent
			- edit, read mail messages
		- mail server
			- contains incoming/outgoing mail messages
		- SMTP
			- handle communication between mail servers, user agent to mail server
			- use TCP at port 25
			- three phases
				- handshake
				- transfer
				- closure
		- mail access protocol
			- retrieval mails from server to user agent
	- DNS
		- domain name system
		- mapping between domain name and IP address
		- use UDP
		- hierarchical distributed database
			- avoid complexity and single point of failure
			- core Internet functions locate at the edes
			- root name servers
				- contacted by local name server
				- contact authoritative name server if mapping not known
			- top-level DNS servers
				- responsible for .com, .org, .net, .edu... and country domain mapping
			- authoritative DNS  servers
				- organization's DNS servers, provide mapping for organization's name
			- local DNS server
				- host's query is send to local DNS server
				- may cache recent responses
				- acts as proxy
		- services
			- hostname and IP translation
			- host, mail server aliasing
			- load distribution
		- resolution
			- iterated query
			  ((61f8ac77-c9b4-4eb3-9edf-a44c9653396c))
			- recursive query
			  ((61f8ac8f-d7fb-43cf-8cbf-d482c60a8680))
			  put burden on upper level DNS servers
		- caching
			- the mapping is cached in DNS server
			- use TTL to decide cache's lifetime
		- records
			- A
				- name (hostname) and value (IP) pair
			- NS
				- name (domain) and value (authoritative DNS server for that domain) pair
			- CNAME
				- name (alias name) and value (canonical name) pair
			- MX
				- name (domain) and value (mail server) pair
		- query and replay message with the same format
		- host aliasing
			- a complicated host name can have more than one alias names
			- the complicated host name is said to be canonical hostname
			- ALIAS record can directly return IP address of a alias name
		- load distribution
			- load distribution among replicated servers
			- a set of IPs is associated with one hostname
			- DNS server return entire list of IPs, but rotate the order before every response
		- [DNS reflection and amplification attack](https://www.bearspace.com.tw/bsitknowhow-infradns/)
	- P2P application
		- increase efficiency of file distribution
			- $D_{C-S}>=max(NF/u_s, F/d_{min})$
			- $D_{P2P}>=max(F/u_s, F/d_{min}, NF/(u_s + \sum u_i))$
			- ((61f8ce83-7dc9-43d1-a844-45b11050224e))
		- distributed hash table (DHT)
			- a distributed P2P database
			- key-value pair
			- allow query, insertion and deletion
			- identifier
				- assign each peer with an identifier
				- convert each key to integer and assign it to peer that has the closest identifier
			- circular DHT
				- each peer only aware its immediate successor and predecessor
					- $O(n)$ messages to resolve a query
				- add shortcuts
					- reduce messages to $O(log N)$
			- peer churn
				- neighbors may come and go
				- regular ping and record up to two successor

	- DASH
		- dynamic, adaptive streaming over HTTP
		- divide video to multiple chunks, and encode those chunks in different rates, than create a manifest file providing url for different chunks
		- client can choose different encoding rate of different chunks base on network bandwidth
