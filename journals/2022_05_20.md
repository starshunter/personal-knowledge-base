		- the [[Insight API]] onboarding request has been approved
		- wrote a small program to test [[Insight API]]
			- first access [[ZTS]] server to get the access token
			- then access Insight API to get the result
				- url is constructed based on tenant name and bucket
				- need to put access token in the header `Authorization`
				- couldn't access the API using the url suggested by the user guide
