	- ## Morning
		- 08:06 #[[Wake Time]]
		- gather notes for [[PI/Standup]]
			- for me, I released pi dashboard to production yesterday, so now you can see the new report in the pi dashboard, and for sherlock, I need to show the partners and the domains that block HLFS or SMP in the UI, and I think adding an extra column in the fact table to store the number of unprocessed image url can help me separate these special domains, so I will implement this method today and see if the UI can display the information correctly
		- [[PI/Standup]]
		- [[Insight API]] came back online #Sherlock
	- ## Afternoon
		- modified the file used to store crawled domain to also store crawling result #Sherlock
			- read the file before writing fact data
				- if the domain couldn't be accessed, then store -1 in the adult image count field
			- [[MIT Team]] wanted to show the domain is blocked in the number of source tag field
				- because I need to determine a domain is blocked or not base on adult image count, I have to do it in `db.js`
				- retrieved a field called min adult image count
				- if this field equals to negative one, then change the number of source tag field to blocked
			- need to also change the rendering of the field in material table
		- [[Clement Staff Meeting]]
			- [[Clement Lee]] said there's a new hire meet up
			- he also said there's a new requirement about [[PI]] need to be done before October
		- used dynamic route for each violation type #Sherlock #[[Dynamic Route]] #[[Next JS]]
			- used violation type lookup from the database to get all the violation type
			- needed to modify links in the home page and in the side bar
			- needed to force components to re-render
				- use `componentDidUpdate` to catch props change
			- be careful of filtering violations
			- columns filter also need to be done after changing page
			- use snake case for table name
	- ## Night
		- errors occurred when jumping between adult monitoring page and search violation page #Sherlock
			- originated from material table
			- made too many changes, unable to identify the cause
			- revert all the change for now
