		- [[Uni/Standup]]
			- [[MingMin Bai]] said I could think a better way to handle the issue raised by [[Ares Huang]] about [[Uni/5714]] [[Pull Request]]
			- she also said [[Uni/Gutenberg to Cosmos Migration]] is just a feasible study task for now
		- the input file still encountered forbidden issue when sending request to [[Insight API]] #Sherlock
			- it may be that [[Insight API]] changed the error code when it receives an outdated access token
				- it returns 403 now
			- encountered inactivity timeout when updating processing status in [[YDS]]
				- need to add a `return` to the end of the status updating function
			- the reprocessing was successful
				- sent a notice to [[MIT Team]]
		- [[PI/Standup]]
	- ## Afternoon
		- wrote API in [[PI/Middleware]] to test [[Statslite]] query #Statslite/Migration
			- the query used a lots of [[Database/View]], and `PIREPORT` doesn't have the permission to create view
			- [[Chih-Yu Ko]] helped to ask for permission
		- [[Trinity Wong]] compiled a document about [[Uni/Gutenberg to Cosmos Migration]]
		- responded to [[Ares Huang]] comment in [[Pull Request]] of [[Uni/5714]], proposed to remain current change
