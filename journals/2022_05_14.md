		  collapsed:: true
			- rebase detects the common ancestor commit of two branch, then detaches current branch and takes the other branch's newest commit as it new base
				- git cannot move the commits, it creates copies of the commits
					- because the hash of the parent of the commit need to be changed
				- the old commits will be garbage collected by git
			- merge preserves the commit history as it was, but may be confusing
			- rebases refactors the commit history
			- tag is like a label of a commit, it can be a simple tag or an annotated tag
				- a annotated tag is made up of two parts
					- a reference referencing to a tag object, which contains the tag's metadata
					- the object points to the actual commit
				- a simple tag is just a reference to the actual commit
			- `git clone` copies the `.git` directory, then rebuilds the working directory using the objects inside it
			- both local branches and remote branches are references to commits
			- if we force push a commit to a remote, while that remote has a new commit our local repository doesn't have, we may lost that new commit on the remote
				- we must resolve the conflict before pushing to the remote
				- if we do rebase on our local repository, since the old commit may be garbage collected, we create a conflict
					- if we try to resolve the conflict by pulling from the remote, we will mess up the commit history
					- so don't rebase commits that have been shared with others
