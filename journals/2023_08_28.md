		- [[Vinayakumar Kolli]] updated the proposed logic explanation #Uni/5932
			- the cases where there's no `ClientID` and `skipClientIdRegen=0` are for other upstreams
			- needed to review how every upstream would get its `ClientID` from [[Uni]]
		- do some experiment on adding a delay before starting [[YDisc]] service
			- to make sure [[Byfor]] could create its [[Database]]
			- created a [[Pull Request]]
		- not sure what API gateway is #Uni/5932
			- it refers to search API gateway [[SAGW]]
			- use `&hspart` to identify its request
	- ## Afternoon
		- used [[Splunk]] to verify new logic can fix the issue and maintain current behavior #Uni/5932
			- asked [[Vinayakumar Kolli]] to verify the new logic
	- ## Night
		- [[警部補大魔神/EP7]]
			- daiba and tanabata tried to retrieve a document that could prove 44's existence

			- daiba kidnapped the cabinet member
			- he also wanted to know about 44's target
			- hirayasu caught the mole, but he aws accused of being the traitor
