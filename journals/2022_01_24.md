	- ex post equity risk premium(ERP) is the actual reward an investor achieve by investing in equity compare to government bond, whereas required risk premium is the the reward that a investor would be willing to invest into equity instead of bond
	- the equity risk premium puzzle
		- in 1985, some researchers found risk aversion in stock market is way higher than other financial area by calculating ERP
		- ERP varied over time, because equity valuation also changed over time
	- even though the argument that riskier assets would have higher return might be right, macro conditions of the economics is still a huge factor in ERP
	- dividends and dividends reinvest can impact returns A LOT!
	- since 2000, dividend yield averaged 1.9%, buyback yielded 2.0%
	- Europe and Japan are similar in terms of index performance, but since Europe tend to have higher dividend ratio, the returns are significantly different
	- market perform best under week economics, low valuation, low volatility of macro conditions and the rate stop deteriorating
	- factors of returns in asset markets
		- timing of the investment
			- it's difficult to identify good timing, but the reward is significant
			- although not realistic to do it daily, avoid periods of recession and rising interest rate, and focus on periods of recovering economic, lower perceived risks and interest rate would definitely help
			- in the right years, bonds' return can be as good as equities
		- valuation at the time of investment
			- good fundamentals doesn't necessary mean good returns, take .com bubble for example
			- high valuation tend to be followed by low returns, and than follow by strong returns
			- in conclusion, higher relative valuations imply low returns in the future

	- storylines of this episode is interesting
	- a once-famous male singer pretended to be high school female singer, and became popular among teenagers
		- once you stopped running, it's hard to start running again #Quote
		- motivation behind this is that he thinks the general publics are fools, chasing flashy appearance instead of focusing on essences
	- a once-prospective journalist struggle about whether to take this news to public, because his son was obsessed with that pretended to-be singer
		- will this news be anywhere valuable? does it benefit to anyone?
		- an unfavorable fact to one person, may be an irreplaceable truth to another #Quote
		- don't have to be ashamed of being moved by the songs, good songs are good, after all #Quote

	- properties and templates
		- use `::` to set properties for pages of blocks
		  title:: test properties
		  author:: Peter Cheng
		  date:: 2022-01-24
		- properties of a page need to be placed as the first block of the page
		- properties, combine with queries, enable us to select pages with same properties
		- create a separate page for all of my custom templates
		- use `/` to call out options and select template
			- [[Testing Template]]
			  title:: testing template
			  author:: Peter Cheng
				- first line
				- second line
			- the above block is inserted by using template

	- first time solving this problem, easy
	- key is to list all possible test cases and make sure the code cover all of them
- [[The Go Workshop/Variables and Operators]]
	- package
		- all golang source code should start with declaring package
		- you should name the package to `main` if you wish to run the package
			- if the package is created to get imported, than name it whatever you want
		- every source code under same directory would be seen as same package, so they should have the same name
		- different source code don't share their import, even if they belong to the same package
	- main function is the entry point of the source code
	- variables
		- need to meet four condition to declare a variable
			- declare statement
			- variable name
			- variable type
			- variable value
		- ways of declaring variable #Golang/Syntax
			- `var <name> <type> = <value>`
			- `var (`
			  `       <name_1> <type_1> = <value_1>`
			  `       <name_2> <type_2> = <value_2>`
			  `)`
			- use `var` keyword, you can declare variables without variable type or initial value
				- compiler will assign zero value to variable without initial value
				- compiler will assign derived type to variable without variable type
			- `<name> := <value>`
			- `<name_1>, <name_2>, <name_3> := <value_1>, <value_2>, <value_3>`
			- `var <name_1>, <name_2>, <name_3> <type>`
			- `var <name_1>, <name_2>, <name_3> = <value_1>, <value_2>, <value_3>`
		- declared but not used variable will cause error at compile time
		- ways of assigning value to variable #Golang/Syntax
			- `<name> = <value>`
			- `<name_1>, <name_2>, <name_3> = <value_1>, <value_2>, <value_3>`
			- you can use short variable declaration to assign values as long as there's a new variable on the LHS
	- operators
		- types of operators
			- arithmetic operators
				- `+-*/%+=-=++--`
			- comparison operators
				- `==!=<<=>>=`
			- logical operators
				- `&&||!`
			- address operators
			- bitwise operators
			- receive operators
	- zero values
		- bool
			- `false`
		- numbers
			- `0`
		- string
			- `""`
		- pointer, function, interface, slice, channel, map
			- `nil`
	- values vs. pointers
		- when passing `int`, `bool`, `string` to function, compiler will make a copy of that value
		- use pointers instead can avoid this overhead
		- once a pointers is declared and point to a value, that value will be placed inside heap
			- normally, values are placed in stack
			- go uses garbage collection to recycle the memory
				- so although using pointers can save memory, garbage collection may cause CPU usage to rise
				- measure than implement
		- when accessing a pointer that doesn't point to anything, runtime error will occur
		- ways of declaring pointer #Golang/Syntax
			- `var <name> *<type>`
				- default value is `nil`
			- `<name> := new(<type>)`
			- `var <name> = new(<type>)`
			- with `new` keyword, compiler will fill in zero value than return its address
			- `<name_1> := &<name_2>`
		- retrieving values from pointers
			- `<value>  = *<pointer>`
			- if trying to dereference `nil` pointer, runtime error will occur
	- constants
		- declaring `const` is just like declaring variable with `var`, but initial values must be provided
		- type of constant is optional
	- enums
		- a way to define a series of constants
		- always be integer, and related to each other
		- use `iota` to simplify constants declaration
	- variable scope
		- when accessing a variable, compiler will search from current scope than go upward, until it finds the variable or reaches package level and throw an error
			- if compiler find a variable with same name but different type, it will also throw an error
		- variable in child scope cannot be accessed from outside

		- weight of information
			- minimal or chunky
		- accessibility required
			- no structured or predictable workflow
		- coherence of output
			- fleeting or permanent
