# Daily Log
	- ## Midnight
		- 00:03 #[[Bed Time]]
	- ## Morning
		- 05:35 #[[Wake Time]]
		- bi-weekly [[Sherlock/Meeting]] with [[MIT Team]]
			- the bug fixes looked good
			- they verified uploading multiple input files in a month feature
				- ready to push to production
			- check the potential new violation type
				- possible to use device type and weighted [[TQ Score]], but needed to check where to get the data
		- [[Uni/Taiwan Sync]]
			- [[Mingmin Bai]] to review the [[Pull Request]] of [[Uni/5817]]
		- learned the [[Uni/Release]] process
			- generate the tag the day before releasing
			- need to check 5 test suites
			- verify the built package and subsystem version
			- [[Performance Test]] may fail
				- as long as the number is not ridiculous, it's ok to ignore it
			- update `yo/ses` about the release
		- [[PI/Standup]]
	- ## Afternoon
		- check the relation between tiny images and inaccessible images #Sherlock
			- when size is under 1000 bytes, 10% of the images are inaccessible
			- we could probably ignore images with size smaller than 2000 bytes, since they are too small to the users
		- found a issue when parsing [[HLFS]] image response #Sherlock
			- the return type of the length of an asset is int64
			- `toObject()` can't parse it correctly
				- though when it's cast to string, [[JavaScript]] could correctly get the size
			- use `decode().toJSON()` instead
				- need to use `parseInt` when getting the asset length
				- may overflow, but it doesn't affect comparing with number
		- studied [[Oozie]] for potential [[Sherlock]] new violation type
