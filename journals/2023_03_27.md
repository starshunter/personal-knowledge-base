# Daily Log
	- ## Midnight
		- 00:13 #[[Bed Time]]
	- ## Morning
		- 05:47 #[[Wake Time]]
		- [[Sherlock]] didn't send notification email once its processing was finished
			- happened both in dev and staging
			- looked like the staging endpoint had some problem, using `testapp` reported a incorrect `appid` issue
		- data looked good on [[Sherlock]] staging
			- no domain inaccessible data produced
			- exclusion was working find
		- [[Sherlock]] can't show the new violations from adult monitoring after changing the date format to year, month, date
			- the [[SQL]] statement produced `NULL` value in `rollup_status`
			- needed to change the way [[Sherlock]] produces current timestamp for adult monitoring
				- use latest timestamp in the violations
				- use `FIRST_VALUE` to select maximum value since there's no `GROUP BY` expression in the subquery
			- uploaded another input to make sure it works fine
		- [[PI/Standup]]
			- [[PI/Standup]] will only be held on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday starting from [[2023/Q2]]
			- there will be a separated [[TW Backend/Sprint Planning]] meeting starting from [[2023/Q2]]
	- ## Afternoon
		- studied [[Uni/5817]]
			- studied how modules use `DataHandleService`
				- they created derived classes from `DataHandle` to read from different files
				- these classes may have different methods to load a file, and offer different methods for different use cases
				- once a `DataHandle` is created, it will stored in [[Cache]] and be reused
			- created a new `DataHandle` class for `TldBoundary`
				- called `TldBoundaryDataHandle`
				- it needs to use `DelimitedTxtReader` to read from the file
				- confirmed with [[MingMin Bai]] about whether this is correct
