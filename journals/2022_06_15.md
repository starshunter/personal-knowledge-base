# Daily Log
	- ## Midnight
		- 02:00 #[[Bed Time]]
	- ## Morning
		- 08:07 #[[Wake Time]]
		- read [[Kubernetes]] guide
		- gather notes for [[PI/Standup]]
			- I was studying the basics of Kubernetes yesterday, and currently I'm learning the concept of persistent volume and persistent volume claim, I think this storage option could serve my use case, help my script to preserve data across restarts, so I plan to learn the detail about how to bind them together, and mount it to a pod to use it as a volume
			- and I also found a sample application that has been configured and can directly deploy to Omega, so I will try to modify its configuration file to add a persistent volume claim on Omega, and verify the volume is accessible inside the pod
		- [[PI/Standup]]
	- ## Afternoon
		- deployed the [[Kubernetes]] hello world application
			- successful
		- read the guide about `omega.ymal` to add persistent volume claim #Kubernetes
			- pvc needed to be created independent of the application
				- used sample YAML file provided by the guide to create in the testing cluster
				- verify it's bound to a pv
				- DONE do I have to request storage through PR in production? #Sherlock
					- how much if I have to
					- no, there is a default quota for every namespace
			- modified the `omega.ymal` in the hello world application
				- mounted successfully
				- notice there are four containers in a pod, so to verify the volume is accessible, remember to enter the correct container
			- modified application to write into a file in the mounted volume
				- the data in the volume was preserved even if the deployment was deleted
				- DONE how should I store data in the file is a question #Sherlock
	- ## Night
		- DONE remember to ask [[Eric Arenas]] about the new sample data #Sherlock
