		- the latest pipeline run showed the wrong labels are still in the result #[[YK Data Pipeline/Consolidation]]
			- suspected the problem is in blending stage
			- tried to run a minified blending stage
			- successfully reproduced the problem
				- when `wiki-zh` is blended with `wiki-en`, the wrong labels appear
			- outlined the reasons and proposed to fix in `wikipedia-texts`
	- ## Afternoon
		- the separated entities issue was fixed in the latest run #[[YK Data Pipeline/Consolidation]]
			- so was incomplete conversion
		- [[CAKE Team]] had initial review on the samples #[[YK Data Pipeline/Consolidation]]
