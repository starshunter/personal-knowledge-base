		- overview
			- key ideas of OOP are data abstraction, inheritance and dynamic binding
			- data abstraction
				- separate interface from implementation using classes
			- inheritance
				- classes are related by inheritance
				- base class defines members that are common in the hierarchy
				- derived classes define members that are specific to themselves
			- dynamic binding
				- ((62107a86-3ce4-424e-a578-4496c31bef0d))
		- define base and derived classes
			- base class
				- base classes normally would define a virtual destructor
				- ((62107d60-f689-4eb5-b732-a73fe1322f8b))
					- add `virtual` to functions that derived classes are expected to override
						- every function, except static and constructor, can be virtual
						- function that is declared virtual in the base class is implicitly virtual in the derived classes
					- ((62107e0a-3dac-434b-b0dc-638e48db8dbc))
					- non-virtual functions are resolved at compile time
				- a derived class can access public members of its base class, but not private members
					- use `protected` access modifier in base class, so derived classes can access, but not outside of the hierarchy
			- derived class
				- derived class inherits from a bass class using class derivation list
				- derived classes can, but not required to, override virtual functions they inherited
					- `virtual` keyword is also not required
				- derived-class objects contain two parts
					- non-static members defined in derived-class
					- members from base class it inherits
					- ((621096de-f71c-4a2d-8014-7ee663dfe6df))
					- ((621097cb-c852-427b-950c-e60e5dee54b1))
						- this is called derived-to-base conversion
						- the conversion is done implicitly
				- constructors
					- ((621098a4-0851-414f-b24c-30542cdde628))
						- use constructor initializer list to pass arguments to a base class constructor
						- base class part in a derived class object is default initialized if we don't specify which constructor to use in initializer list
					- ((6210996f-7bd1-4e17-9954-e2df3be88587))
				- access base class members from derived class
					- derived class can access the `public` and `protected` members of its base class if the inheritance is public
					- ((62109a36-df8c-4a38-9d53-d2c6bd6af546))
						- initialize base class part using base class constructor
				- inheritance of `static` members
					- if a base class defines static member, then there is only one such member defined in the hierarchy
					- we can access static member through base or derived, or even objects
					- ((62109b41-8a35-427a-913f-ba265b8c0713))
				- declare and define
					- declaration of a class only contains the class name, not its derivation list
					- a class can be used as base class only after it has defined
				- prevent inheritance
					- use `final` after the class name to prevent further inhertance
			- conversion and inheritance
				- ((6210d17f-6a3b-4aad-a2b6-b7065fb346a9))
					- we may not know the actual type of the object at compile time
				- static type and dynamic type
					- ((6210d24a-29b8-4312-b506-814eb92841ae))
					- ((6210d262-85ef-487d-9455-7e8cd5f74e47))
					- ((6210d552-e84f-4806-8183-db522035854e))
				- no implicit conversion from base to derived
					- ((6210d58b-6747-483f-af10-a1e4145c9f0d))
					- ((6210d5fe-2d6f-4df0-a752-9bbb38a94da4))
						- we may access derived class members that don't exist in the base class it the assignments are successful
					- ((6210d78f-a858-4f4b-ae8a-fb881177e1bf))
						- compiler has no way to know at compile time if the conversion is safe or not
						- use `dynamic_cast` to check and convert at runtime
					- no conversion between objects
						- the copy constructor and assignment operator of a class take argument of its constant reference
							- so we can pass derived class object base on derived-to-base conversion
						- the conversion is often called slice down since the derived part is ignored
					- base-derived conversion summary
						- ((6210ef94-4f86-4314-9aa7-d3db3def0f62))
						- base object to derived object
							- impossible
						- derived object to base object
							- possible, but sliced
						- base pointer to derived pointer
							- possible, but not implicitly, need `dynamic_cast`
						- derived pointer to base pointer
							- possible
						- base pointer refers to derived object
							- possible
						- derived pointer refers to base object
							- impossible
						-
		- virtual functions
			- ((6210f1dd-0bb7-4b78-a042-56163c3d4928))
			- ((6210eb6b-c696-4e32-b4f8-a45c1ef514ee))
				- we must define every virtual function, because compiler doesn't know whether  a virtual function is used
			- calls to virtual function may be resolved at runtime
				- when a virtual function is called through pointer or reference, the function that is called is the one that corresponds to the dynamic type of the variable
				- a virtual function called through nonreference and nonpointer type is bounded at compile time
					- because we cannot change the type of the object
			- virtual functions in a derived class
				- ((6211096f-5610-4525-b61f-033bda92cce7))
					- return type should also be the same, except for return type with pointer or reference bound to the class itself
			- `final` and `override`
				- use `override` to make our intention clear to the compiler
					- reject function with different parameter list, nonvirtual function or no such function in base class
				- use `final` to prevent a function from being override
			- virtual functions and default arguments
				- base class virtual function default arguments will be used even if function in derived class is called
			- we can call base class virtual function, regardless what the dynamic type of this variable is, using scope operator
				- ((6211177d-a219-4011-af4a-74851783fd69))
				- this is resolved at compile time
		- abstract base classes
			- pure virtual functions
				- a pure virtual function doesn't need to be defined (but it can)
					- if we want to provide definition, it needs to be outside of class body
				- we cannot define objects of class with pure virtual function
					- but constructors may still needed because derived class may use them to initialize its base class part
			- abstract base class
				- ((6211212c-f453-4af8-a847-13cb26f51a7c))
				- it provides an interface for subsequent classes to override
			- derived class constructor only initializes its direct base class
		- access control and inheritance
			- `protected` members
				- `protected` members are inaccessible to users of the class
				- `protected` members are accessible to members and friends of derived classes
					- the accessibility is only through the base class part of derived object, not base class object
			- `public`, `private` and `protected` inheritance
				- ((6211dc45-5326-40be-976e-7471cdb5b737))
				- ((6211dd2c-2672-4bea-addb-be3132ee55ab))
				- ((6211dd40-b238-4655-a006-47c20a471b5d))
			- accessibility of derived-to-base conversion
				- user may use derived-to-base conversion only if derived class inherits publicly from base class
				- members or friends of derived class can use the conversion regardless of how the inheritance is specified
				- members or friends derived from the derived class can use the conversion if the derivation specifier is `protected` or `public`
				- ((6211e1df-e18b-443d-9ddd-3dedb1171b21))
			- friendship and inheritance
				- friends of a base class have no access to members of its derived classes
				- friends of a derive class have no access to members of its base class
				- each class controls access to its own member, so a friend can access base class part of a derived class object
				- friendship cannot be inherited
			- exempting individual members
				- we can change the access level of a member using `using` in derived class
					- this is true only for members in `public` or `protected` section of the base class
			- default inheritance protection levels
				- a derived class defined with `class` keyword has private inheritance
				- a derived class defined with `struct` keyword has public inheritance
		- class scope under inheritance
			- ((62122e7b-bafc-4d6f-b86a-8a38d5b6314c))
			- name lookup happens at compile time
				- static type determines what members can be used
				- ((62123b10-a2f9-475d-82b8-23ba21a2d5b5))
			- name collisions and inheritance
				- names defined in an inner scope hide uses of that name in the outer scope
				- we can use scope operator to use hidden members
			- name lookup happens before type checking
				- functions defined in a derived class don't overload members defined in its base class
				- the search is stopped when a member is found, even if the parameter list is different
			- virtual functions and scope
				- ((62123e65-55c5-4aa8-849d-e6b7eca30249))
				- ((62123fb1-b098-4018-810a-4fab20cf4e4d))
				- ((62123fb9-ae37-47e9-a312-1eb3d9ba4a3b))
				- ((62123ff6-6d93-46b2-8d54-12029cdd17d5))
			- overriding overloaded functions
				- ((6212415b-5de3-4cae-bfce-217e2aa17e64))
				- to avoid redefining all overloaded versions of a member, we can use `using` in the derived class, and define those versions we want to override
		- constructors and copy control
			- virtual destructors
				- ((62124360-e1da-4e93-ad89-189c6671d477))
				- if a base pointer is pointing to a derived class object, then the appropriate destructor needs to be called
				- the virtual nature of the destructor can be inherited
			- synthesized copy control and inheritance
				- if the default constructor, copy constructor, copy assignment operator or destructor in the base class is deleted or inaccessible, then the corresponding member in the derived class is defined as deleted
				- if the base class has inaccessible or deleted destructor, then the synthesized default and copy constructors in the derived classes are defined as deleted
			- derived class copy control members
				- ((62124dd5-69f3-44ec-aeef-52627cff1d2b))
				- ((62125877-e1a5-4a85-b5b5-9d4e2f2bbefa))
				- a derived class assignment operator must assign its base part explicitly
				- a derived class destructor will call its direct base class destructor automatically
					- the calling order of the destructors are back up through the hierarchy
				- ((62125a6b-67b2-4049-8b67-b3a179cc5405))
					- ((62125aa8-7a99-4cfb-a6a9-f94d88d19f2b))
			- inherited constructors
				- ((62125aca-c57b-4da9-a743-05795ebcbb94))
					- use `using` and scope operator
					- ((62125b61-276f-45e9-aa74-bf08881ce58e))
					- the inherited constructors will have the same access level as they have in the base class, no matter where the `using` happens
				- ((62125b13-f074-43e5-86b2-2d795bd7dd8e))
		- containers and inheritance
			- ((62130831-13c0-4790-bf3b-dc7bee48d610))
			- ((621313a0-68d5-4c09-a630-d06c341485ab))
