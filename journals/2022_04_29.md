	- when overriding a method, the return type can be the subtype of the return type of the overridden method
	- ex: when override a method from class `Object`, we can set the return type to be our class
		- ```java
		  public class MyFoo
		  {
		  
		     ...
		  
		     // Note covariant return here, method does not just return Object
		     public MyFoo clone()
		     {
		         // Implementation
		     }
		  }
		  ```
	- without covariant return, we won't be able to change the return type, then we will have to cast the output manually
