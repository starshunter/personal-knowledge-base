	- problem:: Maximum Frequency Stack
	  link:: https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-frequency-stack/
	  difficulty:: Hard
	  duration:: 1 hr
	- first time solving this problem
	- tried to solve it with linked list and iterators, but failed
	- see solution and use two hash tables
	- one for storing the frequency of each number, another for storing the stack of numbers of each frequcny
	- use another variable to track current maximum frequency

	- guarded interfaces
		- every method has a guard
		- the value returned by a method is meaningful only if its guard is true
		- every action method has an enable signal and it can be invoked only if its guard is true
	- hardware synthesis
		- every module represents a sequential machine
		- register is a primitive module
		- input/output wires of a module are derived from its interface
		- rules and methods define the combinational logic to connect registers and modules
	- register
		- implementation is defined outside the language
	- interface defines input/output wires
		- inputs and outputs are defined by the type of the module
	- compiling guards
		- Bluespec design specifies the guard for each method and rule
	- generating enable signals and associated data
		- Bluespec design implicitly specifies the enable signal for each of the called Action and ActionValue method
		- it does so by propagating the incoming enable signals of the calling method or rule
