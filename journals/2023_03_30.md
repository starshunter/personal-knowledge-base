# Daily Log
	- ## Midnight
		- 00:02 #[[Bed Time]]
	- ## Morning
		- 05:46 #[[Wake Time]]
		- started writing [[Unit Test]] for [[Uni/5817]]
		- [[Uni/Taiwan Sync]]
			- [[Mingmin Bai]] said also don't know what `GenericDataLookupModule` does, but it won't affect the output
		- [[Trinity Wong]] started doing [[Uni/Release]]
			- [[Uni/5814]] was released
			- asked [[Bharath Mudegowdar]] to verify it
		- [[PI/Standup]]
	- ## Afternoon
		- finished writing [[Unit Test]] for [[Uni/5817]]
			- cleaned up the old library usage in the modules
			- cast the data handle pointer, and use the `find()` method directly in the modules
			- built package and installed on [[QA]] host
				- the modules can load the file correctly
