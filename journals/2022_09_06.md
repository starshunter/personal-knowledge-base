		- gather notes for [[PI/Standup]]
			- for me, yesterday I was mainly changing Sherlock screwdriver configuration and omega configuration, so that I can deploy it to prod zone, and today Omega team inform me that they will review my namespace update request tomorrow, and there's currently no update on the YDS pes request, also yesterday I looked into the jira api problem [[Chih-Yu Ko]] mentioned in the sprint planning, so it seems like I need to open up ACL through pes in order to use the api from prod zone, so after I can test in the new cluster, I will gather the related information and ask Omega team to help me to open the ACL
