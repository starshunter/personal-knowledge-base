	- ## Morning
		- 08:22 #[[Wake Time]]
		- the pvc was still in the test cluster #Omega
		- gather notes for [[PI/Standup]]
			- yesterday I deployed a sample application to the Omega test cluster to test my Omega configuration, and I mounted a storage space to a pod and used that space to store application data, and the data stored in that volume was preserved even the pod or the deployment was deleted from the cluster, this is the storage option I want to use in Sherlock, so today I will review my adult image detecting script to determine what data should be stored in the persistent volume to prevent data loss
	- ## Afternoon
		- wrote adult monitoring script #Sherlock
			- check the database before sending requests to [[HLFS]] and [[Insight API]]
			- fix incorrect mutex issue
	- ## Night
		- use environment variable inside the script #Sherlock
