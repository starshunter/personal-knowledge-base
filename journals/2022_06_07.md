		- gather notes for [[PI/Standup]]
			- I was modifying the table schema of Sherlock Adult Monitoring, so originally I write input data directly into the table, and now I only write partner with adult image in their referrer domain into the database, so we don't need to join another table while retrieving data for the frontend
			- I also worked on unifying apis and functions that are used both by search violation and adult monitoring, so I can reduce the amount of repeated code
			- I plan to add exclusion list feature to adult monitoring, I will study how to do it in the existing exclusion page, so we don't need to create another page for adult monitoring
		- [[PI/Standup]]
			- Hi, I'm Peter Cheng. I graduated from school last year and just join the team last month, so I'm still pretty new to this job. And I'm currently working on a reporting tool called Sherlock, I am adding a report to it, which can monitor if there's any adult image in our partner's referrer domain
			  id:: 62ba5543-2cb0-406e-80cb-92159ebe8c93
