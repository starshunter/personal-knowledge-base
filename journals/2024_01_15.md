		- looked into requests send by partner with source tag `hk_syndication_ugtd_plus28_pm` #Uni
			- the request result in an invalid [[Bing]] request, because `adServeUrl` has invalid value `plus28.com`
			- gathered all the requests send by this partner and did a [[Performance Test]]
				- [[MSPP]] got an alert about [[Bing]] error rate too high
				- didn't cause [[Core Dump]]
			- the [[QPS]] graph of this particular partner showed the time it send requests, [[Uni]] received [[Core Dump]] notification
			- the requests sent by this partner are mostly invalid
	- ## Afternoon
		- caused a [[Core Dump]] while testing a request from `hk_syndication_ugtd_plus28_pm` #Uni
			- the stack trace is not like what we got in production hosts, but still in [[QNS Panama]]
		- [[Uni/AWE]] ramp up meeting
			- [[Dau-Heng Hsu]] will create a ticket for setting up the environment first #Uni/6261
			- [[Tomek Majchzak]] will assign small tasks to me and [[Trinity Wong]]
			- [[Dau-Heng Hsu]] suggested to create a [[Uni/AWE]] homepage
