# Daily Metrics
	- DONE commit journal
	- DONE workout
	- CANCELED LeetCode Daily Problem
# Daily Log
	- ## Midnight
		- 00:02 #[[Bed Time]]
	- ## Morning
		- 05:44 #[[Wake Time]]
		- [[Vincent Chuang]] fixed the issue in by performance view #PBob #YPI/1660
			- I can't log into [[PI]] staging
			- the b2b host was down
		- bi-weekly [[Sherlock/Meeting]] with [[MIT Team]]
			- DONE allow to exclude referrer domain for all violation types
			  id:: 641c53b3-8efb-4db4-a4c9-544f9a53ab2d
			- DONE drop inaccessible domains when processing the adult monitoring input
			  id:: 641c53cc-cee4-4a5a-ad18-f505b3705e2c
			- DONE review tiny inaccessible images
			- DONE allow users to upload adult monitoring input multiple times a month
			- DONE look into why some inaccessible image urls will download images directly
			  id:: 641c542c-c95a-4e00-8572-82a4bd02eb87
			- DONE will need to add a new violation type, need to explore if some values are accessible on [[Yahoo Grid]]
				- to discuss with [[Fox Wu]]
		- [[Uni/Taiwan Sync]]
			- asked about what do vertical and MMS mean #Uni/5814
				- had a private discussion with [[Ares Huang]]
				- basically vertical means the search that is not web search
				- MMS comes from [[Microsoft]], short of multimedia search
				- talked about why there're cosmos and xml output modules
					- xml is older format, may not be used anymore, still need to use [[Splunk]] to check
		- [[PI/Standup]]
	- ## Afternoon
		- started to implemented feature requests from [[MIT Team]] #Sherlock
			- ((641c53b3-8efb-4db4-a4c9-544f9a53ab2d))
				- modify code in the exclusion page
				- modify logic in [[SQL]] statement
					- only unapproved traffic source and unapproved traffic enhancer will have value in `referrer_domain` field
			- ((641c53cc-cee4-4a5a-ad18-f505b3705e2c))
				- don't write blocked domains to file when processing the input
				- modify table filter
			- ((641c542c-c95a-4e00-8572-82a4bd02eb87))
				- only happened only in `touristtw.imobile01.com`
				- can use the header `Content-Disposition` having `attachment` to filter to out those urls
		- the b2b host was back online #PBob #YPI/1660
			- connection to [[PI/Database]] staging was very unstable
			- verified [[Vincent Chuang]]'s changes was good
			- cleaned up the code
		- worked on [[Uni/5814]]
			- add `rguid` to `<Meta>` in `OutputModule`
			- asked [[Bharath Mudegowdar]] to confirm where [[Uni]] should put the `rguid`, and what should [[Uni]] do about AOL traffic
