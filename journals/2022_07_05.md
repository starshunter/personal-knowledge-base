			- for Sherlock, yesterday I fixed the exclusion list join issue, and I also finished the feature of  using multiple referrer domains in an exclusion rule, and today I plan to look at the dependency alert, which suggested us to upgrade the framework and some other packages used by Sherlock, so I will try to upgrade the packages and see if the code also need to change
