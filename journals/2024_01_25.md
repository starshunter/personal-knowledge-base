- # Daily Log

		- 05:44 #[[Wake Time]]
		- [[Uni/Taiwan Sync]]
			- about blocking inactive [[Source Tag]], still not sure why those are not in the mapping file
				- may need to implement some blocking mechanism
		- worked on [[Uni/6295]]
			- from the [[ScrewDriver]] log, confirmed only than `common` directory, other directories weren't build correctly
				- coverage info is not available
			- tried individual build for each directory
				- can't enable parallel build cause it always fails
			- move the resulting `.gcov` files to their parent directory
				- so [[SonarQube]] could find their matching source files
			- successfully uploaded part of the coverage result to [[SonarQube]]
	- ## Afternoon
		- worked on [[Uni/6296]]
			- understand the service that needs to be refactored
		- worked on [[Uni/6925]]
			- revisited parallel build
				- still missing a lot of `.gcov` files
			- tried individual build for each directory after a top level build
				- the object files already there, so it was quick
				- successfully created all the required files
		- created [[Pull Request]] to address undefined behavior, and initialize the [[SonarQube]] #Uni/6925
