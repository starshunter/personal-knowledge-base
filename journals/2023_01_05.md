# Daily Log
	- ## Midnight
		- 01:33 #[[Bed Time]]
	- ## Morning
		- 08:11 #[[Wake Time]]
		- [[MingMin Bai]] asked about the new ad region #Uni/5714
		- looked at how [[PI/Middleware]] called [[Edlite]] #Statslite/Migration
		- [[PI/Standup]]
		- asked [[Chih-Yu Ko]] about the connection issue with [[PBob]] staging
		- asked [[Chih-Yu Ko]] about how to test [[Statslite]] query in [[PI/Middleware]] #Statslite/Migration
			- he asked [[Jack Chiang]] about this
			- [[Jack Chiang]] said there's a connection from [[Edlite]] to [[PI/Database]]
			- he demonstrated how [[PI/Middleware]] queries [[Edlite]]
	- ## Afternoon
		- met with [[Matt Sanchez]]
		- studied which API [[PI/Middleware]] has that called [[Edlite]] #Statslite/Migration
			- the native report uses [[Edlite]], but it has already been removed from [[PI/Middleware]]
			- `getLatestDate` is still in use
			- cannot connect to [[Edlite]]
		- tried the configuration [[Chih-Yu Ko]] provided #PI/Middleware #Statslite/Migration
			- still couldn't connect to [[Edlite]]
			- maybe need to setup a tunnel in the jump host?
