	- ## Midnight
		- 00:02 #[[Bed Time]]
	- ## Morning
		- 05:50 #[[Wake Time]]
		- worked on [[Uni/6140]]
			- enable [[Bing]] version 7 for [[Unit Test]] in `MultiMediaOutputModule`
			- verified what formatters are still using
				- cosmos for video, xmls for image
			- fix broken [[Unit Test]]
		- [[TW Backend/Standup]]
		- there's an incident while [[ScrewDriver]] tried to generate a new tag for [[Uni]] #Incident/5667680
			- [[Yahoo]] is getting [[ZRP]] from [[Performance Test]] hosts
				- no production impact
			- suspected may cause by removing `BingModule`
			- [[Performance Test]] on [[Bare Metal]] is still using access log from 2019
				- verified the requests would cause [[HTTP/403]] error from [[Bing]]
			- the incident was mitigated after [[Performance Test]] was stopped
	- ## Afternoon
		- figured out the root cause of [[Incident/5667680]]
			- some requests from the access log is sending invalid `appId` to [[Bing]]
				- they are from [[Query Profile]]
			- since I deleted `BingBranchModule` in [[Uni/5979]] and didn't migrate the code of setting default `appId`, the wrong value got sent
			- created a [[Pull Request]] to fix the issue
				- if [[Bing]] version is not set or is not 7, assign the default `appId`
			- not sure if this is the only problem
