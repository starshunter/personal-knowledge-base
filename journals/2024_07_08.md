		- [[Kelly Ke]] found more conversion errors #TWHKSRP/3258
			- mostly about term conversion
			- one error can't be resolved easily, may require us to maintain a list of terms to avoid over converting
				- should discuss it [[Jul 9th, 2024]]
			- don't use a separate step to fixate the terms, fixate them one by one before converting
		- verified the updated converter was still working as expected #TWHKSRP/3258
	- ## Afternoon
		- [[Dau-Heng Hsu/One on One]]
			- [[YK Data Pipeline/Consolidation]] is on schedule
			- he wanted me to bridge the knowledge between [[YK]] and [[Query Understanding]]
		- prepared two [[Pull Request]] to fix HTML extraction problems #TWHKSRP/3258
			- one of them need to confirm with [[CAKE Team]] [[Jul 9th, 2024]]
		- prepared updated on language converter for [[Simon Turnbridge]] #TWHKSRP/3258
