- [[LeetCode Daily Challenge/2022-02]] #[[Hash Table]] #DFS #BFS #Graph
	- problem:: Clone Graph
	  link:: https://leetcode.com/problems/clone-graph/
	  difficulty:: Medium
	  duration:: 40 mins
	- third time solving this problem
	- need a hash table to map original nodes to cloned nodes
	- another hash table for BFS in case of revisiting a node
	- do BFS simultaneously on original graph and cloned graph, add new cloned node when we visit one that hasn't been created
		- actually this problem only requires one queue and one hash table
	- clumsy code
