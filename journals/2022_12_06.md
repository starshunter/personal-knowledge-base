# Daily Log
	- ## Midnight
		- 02:05 #[[Bed Time]]
	- ## Morning
		- 08:26 #[[Wake Time]]
		- [[Uni/Sprint Planning]]
			- [[Justine Mock]] said [[Michael Reyes]] planned to hand over the task to another developer
				- need to check this
		- implemented [[PBob]] request
			- need to add two new buttons to go forward and backward
			- need to know the total number of dimensions
		- [[PI/Standup]]
	- ## Afternoon
		- the dimensions is sorted on the metric being selected, so I need the IDs to select the correct dimensions
			- need to pass the whole list of dimensions to the module
			- need to disable the button when we reach the end
			- the testing so far was good, need more details about the request
				- do I need to show the index of the dimensions being plotted
				- what should I do if the user modify the dimensions directly
