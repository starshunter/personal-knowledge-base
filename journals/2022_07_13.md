		- gather notes for [[PI/Standup]]
			- yesterday, I setup the development environment for PI dashboard, and started to study the code, and I will continue to do that today, also, this morning my request to access HLFS has been granted, I create the athenz role and  policy to consume the role given by the HLFS team, so I will write a script to confirm I can access the endpoint, and then try to run the script I wrote for Sherlock
		- verified I can access [[HLFS]] #Sherlock
			- using curl was successful
			- cannot use in production code
				- 634 unknown client
			- got the same error using hlfsCmd
	- ## Afternoon
		- not able to solve the [[HLFS]] problem #Sherlock
			- tried different roles, endpoints
			- seemed like the checking endpoint doesn't need authorization header
			- asked question in slack channel
	- ## Night
		- finished [[PI/Dashboard]] frontend UI update
