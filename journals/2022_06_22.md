		- gather notes for [[PI/Standup]]
			- yesterday I looked at Sherlock's frontend structure to see which part should be changed to add the new home page, I think I can use the component I wrote to build a page for each violation type, and pass the custom columns of that violation type into the page to display them, and I don't think I need to write new APIs or modify the old one, I can use the existing one to retrieve all the violation data, then filter it before rendering the page to display only the violations of that violation type, so this is what I'm doing right now
		- [[PI/Standup]]
		- fixed some broken features on violation page
	- ## Afternoon
		- changed date representation in adult monitoring table
		- asked [[Fox Wu]] about adult monitoring's partner id
			- he suggested me to look at the apollo feed to verify the publisher id is indeed pubcenter id
			- I don't need to modify `dim_partners`
		- multiple places need to be changed because of using pubcenter id as partner id
	- ## Night
		- insert new data into local database
		- modify the functions in `db.js`
		- DONE the script need to be changed
		- prepared some questions for tomorrow's [[Sherlock/Meeting]]
		  id:: 62c4f4c4-334c-42cd-a681-f14656539c2b
			- I'm working on a new home page design, because right now in the search policy violation table, there are many columns to display different metrics, but not every violation type needs all those metrics, some violation type only needs one or two of them, so this results in a sparse representation of data, and if there are more violation type in the future, this table may grow even bigger, so I'm working on letting each violation type to have its own table, which will only display the metrics that violation type needs, I hope this will make the ui more intuitive, but I will retain the current table, so if you are already used to doing your work on it you can still use the original table
			  id:: 62c4f4c4-98ec-40ee-8891-62e91dccd7d2
			- in order to display the market of a source tag, I need this field to be in the input data
			- there's a publisher ID column in the input data, so in order to get the information of this partner, like partner manager name, I need to retrieve it from the apollo feed, so I assume publisher ID corresponds to the MicroSoft's publisher center's customer ID in the apollo feed, but I'm not sure if this assumption is correct
