	- ## Morning
		- 05:44 #[[Wake Time]]
		- looked like no need to work on [[Uni/5838]]
			- number of result and response time are already being returned to [[SFE]], they just need to read and showthem
		- [[PI/Standup]]
	- ## Afternoon
		- studied how [[Uni]] handle the response from [[Bing]]
			- after receiving the raw response, `BingSearchService` will call the deserializer to pares the response, include parsing the header and the response body
				- uses `BingResponseHeader.parseBingHeaders` in `BingLibrary` to parse headers
				- uses `BingSearchResponseParser` to parse the response [[JSON]] to `BingResponse` defined in `BingLibrary`
					- first enter `parseJsonToBingSAXData`
					- parse the response section by section
				- after finishing parsing, `moduleCallback` in `BingSearchModule` will store the parsed response in `BingSAXData`
					- `BingSAXData` is defined in `BingResponse`
