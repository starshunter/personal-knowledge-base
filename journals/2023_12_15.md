		- [[Ruby Loo]] left some comments on my [[Uni/6228]] [[Pull Request]]
			- addressed them
		- [[Uni/Standup]]
			- to review [[MingMin Bai]] [[Pull Request]] about useless endpoints
			- should clarify what's the scope of [[Gutenberg]] migration first
	- ## Afternoon
		- studied how the users use [[Gutenberg]]
			- the [[UI]] is quite complicated, not sure if [[COSMOS]] can handle it
		- [[Gutenberg/Migration]] meeting
			- [[Gutenberg]] is planned to be [[EOL]]
			- [[COSMOS]] [[UI]] is being migrated to [[Wizard]] style
			- [[Agigo Sung]] to check what's the effort to migrate data from [[Oracle]] [[Database]] to [[MYSQL]], and the plan for [[UI]] migration
			- on [[Uni]] side, need to check what fields in the [[QP]] file can be deprecated
