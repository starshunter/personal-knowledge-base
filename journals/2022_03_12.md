  collapsed:: true
	- hanae and ashida kissed at a family restaurant
	- hanae mentioned the only task left about their relationship was breaking up
	- hanae found out she had to be in hospital two days before the surgery
	- so she shifted their break up day earlier
	- shingo, rin and hanae went to find hanae's father
	- hanae's father also likes start line
	- shingo went to see ashida, challenged him not to break up with hanae
	- ashida tried to maintain their relationship but failed
	- hanae had the surgery
	- ashida finished his new song, but shigo didn't allow him to meet with hanae

	- problem:: Copy List with Random Pointer
	  link:: https://leetcode.com/problems/copy-list-with-random-pointer/
	  difficulty:: Medium
	  duration:: 20 mins
	- third time solving this problem
	- trivial using hash table, so tried to do it with constant space
	- need three iterations to construct new list
		- first iteration to create cloned node, and point the original node's next pointer to the cloned node
		- second iteration to point cloned node's random pointer to targeted cloned node
		- third iteration to point cloned node's next pointer to its next node, and restore original node's next pointer
	- need to consider the case where random pointer points to null pointer, so we have to check beforehand in case of trying to access a member of null pointer

	- shift operators
	  collapsed:: true
		- fixed size shift operation is cheap in hardware
		- shift n can be broken down into log n steps of fixed length shifts
		  collapsed:: true
			- 1, 2, 4, 8, 16
			- tradeoff delay for size
	- boolean optimizations
	  collapsed:: true
		- every function can be described as a truth table
		- use sum-of-products to represent the truth table
		  collapsed:: true
			- also called normal form
			- unique but not optimal
		- a minimal sum-of-products is an expression that has the smallest possible number of AND and OR operators
		  collapsed:: true
			- not unique
		- ways to optimize
		  collapsed:: true
			- truth tables' don't cares
			- multi-level circuits
			- common subexpression optimization
			  collapsed:: true
				- factor out common subexpressions
				- increase the number of logic levels
	- logic synthesis
	  collapsed:: true
		- combinational circuit properties
		  collapsed:: true
			- area and propagation delay
			- derived from the gates used to build the circuit
		- logic optimization
		  collapsed:: true
			- optimized circuit is very complex
			- write circuits in a hardware description language, and use a synthesis tool to derive optimized implementations
