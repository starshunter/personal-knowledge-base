		- gather notes for [[PI/Standup]]
			- for me, yesterday I was studying how the API used by PI dashboard retrieve data from the database, and see what change I need to make to get data for fast type report, also yesterday I resolved the error I got when I tried to use HLFS in my script, turned out it's because HLFS team forgot to add my client id to their config file, after they updated the file, I can access the endpoint successfully, so this morning, I ran my script with a small set of input data, and for most of the case, it can crawl the image url for a given domain, then feed them to SMP, but for some websites, the way they display images on their page is different from what I expected, so my script cannot extract image url correctly, so I will take a look at these websites and figure out how to handle them
		- [[PI/Standup]]
	- ## Afternoon
		- tried to run the script #Sherlock
			- not good, [[HLFS]] couldn't crawl some domains, and some images couldn't be downloaded by [[SMP]]
			- might need to try to change the request type to `wiretap`
				- it basically retrieves every files it has to download to render the page
				- need to modify browser options as well
	- ## Night
		- couldn't find a picture of myself
