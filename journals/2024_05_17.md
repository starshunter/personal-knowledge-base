		- [[Uni/Standup]]
		- the item added by [[Kelly Ke]] didn't show up in the latest [[Wikidata]] #TWHKSRP/3251
			- some entities updated a few days before also didn't reflect in the data
			- seems like daily update only applies to certain entities that
				- we already extract them
				- they have an English [[Wikipedia]] page
			- other entities have to wait for weekly data dump
			- US [[YK Team]] downloads the data dump on Saturday
			- told [[Kelly Ke]] about my findings
	- ## Afternoon
		- tried to study `ykc` repo #[[YK Data Pipeline/Consolidation]]
			- it's written in [[Scala]]
	- ## Night
