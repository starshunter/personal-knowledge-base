# Daily Log
	- ## Midnight
		- 01:36 #[[Bed Time]]
	- ## Morning
		- 07:22 #[[Wake Time]]
		- [[Sherlock]] bi-weekly meeting
			- [[Eric Arenas]] decided to use two models, both with threshold 0.4 #[[Insight API]]
			- told [[Chih-Yu Ko]] some [[DRT]] tasks
		- gather notes for [[PI/Standup]]
			- for uni, I'm discussing the output format with the frontend engineer right now, we need to decide how uni should send the unique fields in credit card ads to front end, and for sherlock, this morning's meeting MIT review the scores comparison between version 3 model and version 4 model, and they decided sherlock should use these two models together to decide whether an image is not safe for work or not, so there will be two threshold for these two models, and only when an image's score exceed these two threshold will it be marked as not safe for work, so I will send the sample file to MIT once the script finish running, and start to implement this change once I get their confirmation
		- [[PI/Standup]]
		- [[Michael Reyes]] wanted to know how many images will there be per a credit card ad #Uni/5714
			- asked [[Justine Mock]]
	- ## Afternoon
		- started to look at how to write [[Unit Test]] #Uni/5714
			- need a sample response first
			- not sure how many test cases is needed
		- sent an email to [[MIT Team]] about the result using two models #Sherlock #[[Insight API]]
