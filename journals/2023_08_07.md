- # Daily Log
	- ## Midnight
		- 00:25 #[[Bed Time]]
	- ## Morning
		- 05:42 #[[Wake Time]]
		- aligned the naming in [[Uni/5966]] [[Pull Request]]
		- [[Yahoo/Summer Intern/Daily Standup]]
		- [[Tomek Majchzak]] asked to review his [[Pull Request]] in [[Uni/AWE]]
			- asked some questions about the [[Uni/Migration]] guide
	- ## Afternoon
		- [[Tomek Majchzak]] mentioned me in the [[Pull Request]] about [[Uni/5966]] in [[Uni/AWE]]
			- he proposed to allow empty source tag get into the function
			- the logic in that [[Pull Request]] request is slightly different than what I understand
				- need confirmation
		- assigned [[Uni/5972]] to myself
			- need to remove `QuicklinksModule`
			- the module only applies to non- [[Uni/GConf]] response
			- confirmed all [[Bing API]] request are version 7, so the module can be safely removed
	- ## Night
		- [[警部補大魔神/EP4]]
			- tanabata provided evidence to prove daiba's innocence
			- he told her about amo's crime
			- daiba caught a 44 killer was trying to kill a writer
			- that killer jumped off the roof, but the corpse was taken away
			- the killer was still killed by another killer
			- tanabata's team found a skull near amo's house
			- daiba suspected it was 44's trap
			- tanabata was able to escape from 44's killers
			- daiba and tanabata buried the bodies together
