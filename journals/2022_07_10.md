			- for Sherlock, I mainly focused on rewriting the SQL queries, because using one database table is enough to store both search policy violations and adult monitoring data, and it can make the queries simpler, since they only need to read data from one table, and all the filtering will be done in each page before the content is rendered
			- also, because there was a security alert about vulnerable packages, so last week I updated the framework and styling package Sherlock uses, and because they both need to update to next major version, I needed to changed some project configuration, and migrate the UI to newer version as well, the change has been deployed to staging environment, and it works fine as previous version so far
			- for PI dashboard, I plan to study the document and the code first, and then setup the development environment, once finish, I will start to add the fast type report to the dashboard
			- for Sherlock, last week MIT said they will have a meeting with HLFS team, so we should know what's the onboarding status soon
