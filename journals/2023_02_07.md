# Daily Log
	- ## Midnight
		- 00:03 #[[Bed Time]]
	- ## Morning
		- 05:41 #[[Wake Time]]
		- [[Shruthi Shyamala]] wanted me to validate parameters that only request PLA #Uni
			- not sure what to validate
			- built the package again to remove `TextAds` from those parameters
		- [[Uni/Meeting]]
			- [[MingMin Bai]] had a session about [[Uni/Deployment]]
		- [[PI/Standup]]
			- [[Vincent Chuang]] joined the team
		- used the built package to see the response after removing `TextAds` from the parameters #Uni
			- the [[Bing]] request looked good, but there's no ad being returned
	- ## Afternoon
		- checked the difference between my dev machine and the production host #Uni
			- production host can get PLA
			- after setting `enProductAds=0`, there's only Text ads in the response
			- my dev host can't get any ad after removing `TextAds`
			- otherwise it can correctly get PLA
		- asked [[Shruthi Shyamala]] what does she want to check #Uni
			- mentioned [[Laura Calverley]] already tested removing `TextAds` from the parameters
			- offer the request to my dev machine, and the [[Bing]] request
		- [[Clement Staff Meeting]]
			- performance review will be held in the following two weeks
			- self introduction to [[Vincent Chuang]]
		- seemed like Text ads will not be showed in the [[Uni]] response
			- they only appeared in [[Bing]] response
			- may need to check with [[Laura Calverley]] or [[Shruthi Shyamala]]
