- # Daily Log

		- 00:04 #[[Bed Time]]
	- ## Morning
		- 07:19 #[[Wake Time]]
		- [[Simon Turnbridge]] suggested to run the enricher twice #[[YK Data Pipeline/Consolidation]]
			- enricher should also be able to remove disambiguation text in specialized label
		- updated [[Pull Request]] about enabling daily update #[[YK Data Pipeline/Consolidation]]
		- [[Dau-Heng Hsu]] found out some previously disappear [[KG]] showed up again #[[YK Data Pipeline/Consolidation]]
			- the bug fix was still in staging
				- verified the issue had been fixed, [[Simon Turnbridge]] will push to production
			- not sure why some entities could recon successfully
	- ## Afternoon
		- approved [[Trinity Wong]] [[Pull Request]] about deprecating old attributes #Gutenberg/Migration
		- asked [[Tomek Majchzak]] about [[Uni/6483]]
			- he suggested not to replace [[QP]] files directly
				- [[AWE Data]] may update to new version
			- we may use a [[ConfigMap]] to change the path where [[Uni/AWE]] read the file, and replace the file there
				- details still not clear
		- worked on a document about [[Uni/6483]] options
