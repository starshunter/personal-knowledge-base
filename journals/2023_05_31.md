# Daily Log
	- ## Midnight
		- 23:57 #[[Bed Time]]
	- ## Morning
		- 07:39 #[[Wake Time]]
		- custom deleter won't work #Uni/5885
			- it can only take one argument
		- [[PI/Standup]]
	- ## Afternoon
		- had a meeting with other mentors of [[Yahoo/Summer Intern]]
			- talked about the idea of preview in [[Trending Now]]
		- [[Tomek Majchzak]] started to review [[Uni/5885]]
			- two major improvement needed, one is recycling the stream from terminated thread, another is not to create temporary config file when running [[Unit Test]]
			- he also started to review [[Uni/5849]]
		- thought about how to recycle stream object [[Uni/5885]]
			- need to do it when the thread is terminated
			- the resource set by `pthread_setspecific()` will call the destructor used in `pthread_key_create()`
				- modified class `DHStream` so it has a pointer to the pool that hold its member variable `stream`
				- the destructor needed to be a static member function of the service, and its signature need to be `void (void *)`
				- passed the function pointer into `TLSHandles` constructor
				- the destructor needed to use pool pointer inside `DHStream` to put its `stream` back to the pool
