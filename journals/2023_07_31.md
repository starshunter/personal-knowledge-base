		- [[MingMin Bai]] suggested me to use a helper function to test different query type #Uni/5969
			- use `enum` to list different query types
			- add two [[Unit Test]] for image and video search
		- [[Tomek Majchzak]] had some doubts about how I trimmed the query #Uni/5969
			- discussed about what characters may be inside the input string
				- confirmed there will be no [[HTML]] tags, cause [[Uni]] set `textFormat=Raw`
			- don't escape the string, because we want the unescaped query when searching for [[Uni/RTBF]] matches
			- updated the [[Pull Request]]
		- [[Yahoo/Summer Intern/Daily Standup]]

		- [[Ares Huang]] asked about my [[2023/Q3]] goals for [[Aug 1st, 2023]] [[TW Search all-hands]]
