	- ## Morning
		- 05:35 #[[Wake Time]]
		- booked a time with [[Kelly Ke]] to discuss [[Wikidata]] data completeness #TWHKSRP/3251
		- had a sync-up with [[Simon Lee]] #[[YK Data Pipeline/Consolidation]]

	- ## Afternoon
		- [[TW Backend/General Update]]
			- [[Josh Manzano]] and [[William Huang]] were let go
		- worked on a script to extract TvSeries and its attributes from [[Wikidata]] #TWHKSRP/3251
			- since US [[YK Team]] only extract entities with `instance of` attribute, only focus on those entities
				- entity loss rate may be higher than before
		- [[Kelly Ke]] provided the list #TWHKSRP/3251
		- wrote a script to analyze TvSeries result #TWHKSRP/3251
