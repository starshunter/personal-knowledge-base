- previous [tags solution](((61ec20de-4028-4204-aff7-864166b4a148))) didn't work with further inspection #Logseq/Integration
	- change tags in /_posts into - tag1 -tag2 -tag3 instead
	- display on GitHub page good
	- tags of those posts don't show in logseq's graph view anymore, but that's fine
- I find that logseq is less customizable than Obsidian, so I need to adjust most change on Obsidian side
- about to study some basic logseq use case from youtube when riding the bike
- learn some knowledge management concepts about what logseq actually build on #Logseq/Concept
	- block is the minimal granularity of information
	- with outliner, we can write all our thought, span through different topics, in one place
		- by using backlink and tag, we are able to retrieve information about specific topic with ease
	- frictionless input and efficient retrieval is the key to build your second brain, and logseq can do that!

	- main actress' style is quite... interesting
	- can't recognize supporting actor at first glance
	- storyline is quite predictable, but I find the scene where main actress talked about how she had lost motivation about her life at age 30 touching
	- overall, I'll give EP2 a shot

  id:: 61f542d9-0ea9-41bc-9b4c-a866c892b922
	- problem:: Sequential Digits
	  link:: https://leetcode.com/problems/sequential-digits/
	  difficulty:: Medium 
	  duration:: 30 mins
	- first time solving this problem
	- a bit of brute force
	- didn't think of two edge cases
	- surprise that it can be solved using BFS
		- consider numbers that differ in last digit as adjacent nodes
		- put every one digit number into queue initially
	- write a post about it, [[2022-01-23-LeetCode-解題-1291-Sequential-Digits]]

	- can't last 10 mins..., give up
- Test on iphone #Logseq/Mobile
	- success!!
- learn some basic logseq #Logseq/Basic
	- use `shift + enter` to change line within block
	  like this
	- `/` to call out options
	- tags have the same functionality as links
	- use `command + enter` to call out task management tagging
	- use `/` to set different priority for each tasks
	- add tag `#card` to the end of blocks to create flashcards
	- use date to create link on the journal
		- [[2022-01-22 Saturday]]
	- tags and links' are irrelevant of to letter case
	- press `shift` and click on link or tag to open page on the right side
	- I can drag block between pages
	- block reference
		- right click on a block to copy block reference
		- or press `option` and drag block to create block reference
		- or type `((text))` to search for text and create block reference
	- re-index to fix most of the problems
	- good indention make information retrieval more efficient
	- change the title of a page will also change every linked references' text
	- use favorites in the left sidebar for setting up entry points
