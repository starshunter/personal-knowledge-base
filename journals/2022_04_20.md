	- $ROA=\frac{net \space income}{average \space total \space assets}$
	- ROA measures the company's efficiency of utilization its assets
	- some companies will choose to add interests to net income to have a better measurement
	- the primary difference between ROA and ROE is what utilization efficiency is measure on
		- ROA considers debts, but ROE does not
	- ROA is suitable for evaluating companies with high leverage
		- using ROE to evaluate these companies will result in fake impression that companies increase their efficiency, but in essence most of the profit is generated by debt
	- big difference between ROA and ROE is a warning sign
	- the higher the ROA the better
	- compare a company's multiple years ROA to find the trend
