# Daily Log
	- ## Midnight
		- 02:35 #[[Bed Time]]
	- ## Morning
		- 08:11 #[[Wake Time]]
		- let user to upload input data while the script is still running #Sherlock
			- input file format: `input_data_{TIME_ID}.txt`
			- working file format: `working.txt`
			- finished input file format: `finished_{TIME_ID}.txt`
		- gather notes for [[PI/Standup]]
			- for me, I was studying why there's a delay between API calls when I update the status of an image in the UI, then I figure out reason, so basically when the user decide that all the adult images in a domain found by Sherlock are actually clean, not only the score of each image need to update, the violation itself also need to be removed from the database because it's a false positive violation, and this action is an asynchronous action and I didn't handle it in my code, so it results in an empty response from the API, and the frontend cannot determine whether the API call is successful or not so the delay happens, so I already fix this issue, and I'm doing more test on this feature
		- [[PI/Standup]]
	- ## Afternoon
		- found an issue about a same image used by multiple domains #Sherlock
			- current implementation only update image count in current domain
			- need to get all affected domains
				- return from `updateImageScore`
			- doesn't need to change `updateFactData`, just call it multiple times in `ViolationTable`
		- [[Clement One on One]]
			- talked about what I did lately
			- demo my changes in manual review
				- [[Clement Lee]] suggested I could make the message in rollup table clearer
			- talked about input data
				- he didn't suggested me to propose a solution
				- discussed what's the major obstacles of implementing a solution myself
				- if the result is not proportionated to the work, we should not do it
			- talked about how I felt about work
				- pace was too slow
	- ## Night
		- fixed the scrolling status missing issue when expanding a violation #Sherlock
			- I used the wrong ref
		- changed the blocked message in rollup view #Sherlock
		- self introduction for tomorrow's [[PI/Standup]]
