# Daily Log
	- ## Midnight
		- 01:40 #[[Bed Time]]
	- ## Morning
		- 08:11 #[[Wake Time]]
		- decided to classify the images using [[Insight API]] `nsfw_v3` and `nsfw_v4`
		- gather notes for [[PI/Standup]]
			- for Sherlock, so last Friday, MIT discussed the scoring of the images Sherlock has found with SMP team, because they thought the result was not accurate enough, and SMP team suggested we could try another image classification model for our use case, so I'm changing Sherlock to use this new model in my dev environment, and generate the scores for the same set of images, so after it is done, maybe today or tomorrow, I can provide the comparison of the results of two models to MIT
		- [[PI/Standup]]
	- ## Afternoon
		- [[Clement One on One]]
			- talked about [[Sherlock]] process
			- talked about [[Uni]] process
			- he is open to letting either me or [[Trinity Wong]] to take the task
			- he wanted us to share knowledge
		- [[Trinity Wong]] almost finished the request #Uni
			- she will take the task
		- studied how to write [[Unit Test]] #Uni
