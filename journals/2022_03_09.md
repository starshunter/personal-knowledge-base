		  title:: Compiling Code, Procedures and Stacks
	- dealing with constants
	  collapsed:: true
		- constants less than 12 bits can be handle by immediate instructions
		- load upper immediate
		  collapsed:: true
			- load constant into upper portion of instruction
			- ((6228a141-6d11-427b-9855-56a2a506016c))
	- compiling program
	  collapsed:: true
		- steps
		  collapsed:: true
			- assign variables to registers
			- translate operators into computational instructions
			- use register immediate instructions to handle operations with small constants
		- conditionals
		  collapsed:: true
			- `if` statement can be compiled using branches
			- ((6228a2c1-8dd9-4c85-b145-33a5e4aa1292))
			- sometimes using other kind of instruction can result in less instructions
		- loops
		  collapsed:: true
			- loop can be compiled using backward branches
			- ((6228a2ec-7e4c-4a2d-8abe-0918b747f6b6))
	- procedures
	  collapsed:: true
		- procedure allows us to reuse certain code
		- a procedure in assembly
		  collapsed:: true
			- need a entry point
			- may have zero or more parameters
			- need local storage
			- may return value to the caller
		- a caller uses the same register set as the called procedure
		  collapsed:: true
			- partition register set for caller and procedure is unrealistic
			- caller or callee saves the caller's registers in memory and restores them later
		- parameters passing and returning value are both done through registers
		- to allow procedure to return control back to caller, we need a way to let the procedure know where to jump back
		  collapsed:: true
			- return address must be saved and passed to the called procedure
			- jump and link
			  collapsed:: true
				- ((6228a991-b19c-4650-803b-0fa61de28d94))
		- return address may be wiped out if the called procedure calls another procedure
		  collapsed:: true
			- registers stored in memory may also encounter similar problem
			- data that a procedure needs is called activation record
		- we need a data structure to hold activation records, using stack achieve this
		  collapsed:: true
			- stack is in memory so we need a register to point to it
				- this pointer is store in `x2`
			- stack grows down from higher to lower addresses
			- we need to allocate new stack storage before calling the procedure
				- ((6228aeb1-f9c1-43dc-aaae-b7a1ef7dd0cd))
				- same thing must reverse need to be done before returning
		- calling convention
		  collapsed:: true
			- rules for register usage
			- ((6228af21-ce08-42fd-b387-6636480069a9))
			  collapsed:: true
				- we may assume value in saved registers will remain the same after calling a procedure, whereas we cannot make such assumption on temporary registers
			- caller saved registers are not preserved across function calls
			  collapsed:: true
				- they must be saved onto the stack before transferring control
			- callee saved registers are preserved across function calls
			  collapsed:: true
				- if callee wants to use them, it must save those values on stack and restore them before returning
