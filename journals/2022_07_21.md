		- Sherlock bi-weekly meeting #Sherlock/Meeting
			- [[Chih-Yu Ko]] proposed to move the meeting thirty minutes earlier
				- DONE next meeting will be on
				  SCHEDULED: <2022-08-11 Thu 08:00>
			- [[Jasmine Basci]] gaver her update
				- asked what's the status of [[HLFS]] [[Jira]] ticket
					- I already got the access, she confirmed with the owner
				- asked about the new input data
					- I already used it in development environment
			- I told them I need more url for a given domain to get more images
				- [[Jasmine Basci]] said she will discuss this with [[Eric Arenas]]
				- I will look at the document again to see what I can do
			- I told them some domains are blocking [[HLFS]] from accessing their contents
				- [[Jasmine Basci]] thought the ratio is acceptable
				- I should put those domains in the adult monitoring page and show the users that they block us from accessing
		- [[TW Open House]]
	- ## Afternoon
		- gather notes for [[PI/Standup]]
			- for Sherlock, I was reviewing the errors I got from HLFS and SMP, for HLFS, nearly ji320 percent of the requests return an error, and about 50 of these errors result from the owner of the domain blocking crawler from crawling their pages, and for other errors, I'm trying to send the domain request one by one to get more specific error message, and for SMP, I skip images that are too small in size, and also skip the image formats that are not supported by SMP, but I still got errors on 10% of my image requests, most of the errors just said SMP failed to download the image to process it, so I will try to figure out how to fix it
		- [[PI/Standup]]
			- [[Clement Lee]] asked me how was the meeting with [[MIT Team]] going
		- send individual request to [[HLFS]] for every domains that are not responded with 550 error code #Sherlock
			- some of them can be fixed by turning off adblock
			- adjusting `maxFrameToLoad` also resolve some domains' error
		- ran the script again using the new [[HLFS]] request setting #Sherlock
			- 9 less domains failure
			- image count decreased, but failure ratio became lower
			- some domains are not accessible in browser, and some others are not accessible via HLFS
	- ## Night
		- wrote down failure domains reason #Sherlock
