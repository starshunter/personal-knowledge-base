# Daily Log
	- ## Midnight
		- [[Old Rookie/EP7]]
		  collapsed:: true
			- kanako's book was published
			- yoshiki hoped victory could help him to find sponsors
			- yoshiki hoped to changed to a better wheelchair
			- yoshiki planned to changed the wheelchair company
			- victory couldn't find more sponsors

			- he won the competition
		- 02:03 #[[Bed Time]]
	- ## Morning
		- 08:22 #[[Wake Time]]
		- [[Jasmine Basci]] sent the [[Jira]] ticket template #Sherlock
			- added it the code
		- [[Fox Wu]] mentioned I should change the variable name of violation type id #Sherlock
		- gather notes for [[PI/Standup]]
			- for me, yesterday I was changing Sherlock's config to make it more concise, and this morning, I receive the jira ticket template for adult monitoring from MIT, so I'm adding it to Sherlock and plan to test the result later
		- [[PI/Standup]]
		- learn [[C++]] on [[Pluralsight]]
	- ## Afternoon
		- [[Fox Wu]] mentioned my cron job setting is wrong
			- should specify actual number for minute field
			- he also asked me to update the [[SQL]] query used to delete violations that are excluded by exclusion
	- ## Night
		- gather notes for tomorrow's [[PI/Standup]]
			- for me, yesterday I put the jira ticket template into the code and see what would be the content of the ticket if the user file one, and I also add more instruction in uploading page, so the user could know what is the correct format of the file to upload, and today there's a new hire meetup at the office, so this afternoon I will be attending this event
