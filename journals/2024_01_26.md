		- [[Uni/Standup]]
		- tried to refined coverage build process #Uni/6295
			- it took about 15 mins to generate all `.gcov` files
			- tried to understand why `testcoverage/os-platforms` would miss some directories
				- [[Uni]] didn't define `SUBDIRS` in those directories' [[Makefile]]
			- add `gcov-analysis` to parallel build
			- succeed to generate all required files in one run
			- combined with code analysis build using [[SonarQube]] build wrapper, it took around 15 minutes to finish
	- ## Afternoon
		- worked on [[Uni/6296]]
			- created separated `TermValidator` class
			- wrote [[Unit Test]] for new class
				- doesn't depend on external files
