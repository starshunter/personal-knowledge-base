		- [[Uni/Sprint Planning]]
			- to verify [[Istio]] is working for [[Isotope]] after [[Uni/Release]]
		- started [[Uni/Release]]
			- verified [[Uni/6024]] in `tp2` [[Pod]]
		- rewrote [[Unit Test]] in [[Uni/5738]] [[Pull Request]]
			- pushed update
	- ## Afternoon
		- worked on [[Uni/6374]] [[Pull Request]]
			- made the helper a stand alone class
			- instantiate the helper for each request
				- can't use it as [[Java/Spring Framework/Bean]] since it needs to take in two log fillers, and it may not be thread-safe
			- added [[Unit Test]] for the helper
			- pushed update
