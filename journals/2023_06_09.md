		- [[Uni/Standup]]
			- [[MingMin Bai]] thought sending a sample event is not appropriate #Uni/5885
				- to think of better approach
			- needed to update [[Uni/5861]] [[Pull Request]] to append `dnsc=1` to MMA assets
				- if the link is not getting wrapped, we don't need to append
			- [[MingMin Bai]] asked [[Trinity Wong]] and I take to take one of [[Uni/5900]] and [[Uni/5906]]
		- [[Fox Wu]] approved my [[Pull Request]] #Sherlock
			- deployed [[Oozie]] job
			- insert new violations mapping to production [[YDS]]
		- updated [[Uni/5861]] [[Pull Request]]
	- ## Afternoon
		- [[Trinity Wong]] had no preference to choose which ticket to work on
			- I chose [[Uni/5900]] to work on
		- worked on [[Uni/5900]]
			- needed to return impression ID, impression GUID, client ID and search ID for all [[Syndi]] traffic
			- not sure what impression ID is
