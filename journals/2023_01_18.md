		- [[Sesh Suravaram]] said he had granted PIREPORT the permission #Statslite/Migration #Edlite
			- still can't create new view
		- [[Uni/5700]] has been merged, need to resolve the merge conflict
		- [[PI/Standup]]

			- he approved the [[Pull Request]]
		- [[MingMin Bai]] assigned the ticket [[Uni/5759]] to me
			- need to update my study in the comment
		- had problem creating view because PIREPORT cannot read from some tables #Statslite/Migration #Edlite
			- told [[Chih-Yu Ko]] about this
			- he asked [[Sesh Suravaram]] to look into this
