		- considered potential solution to deal with entity loss problem #TWHKSRP/3246
			- maybe entities can be extracted from [[Wikidata]]
	- ## Afternoon
		- [[YK Data Pipeline/Consolidation]]
			- discussed my finding about entity loss #TWHKSRP/3246
				- agreed to put this option on hold
			- [[Dau-Heng Hsu]] proposed to study what are not available in US pipeline
			- proposed another solution, to extract entities from [[Wikidata]]
				- discussed with [[Simon Lee]]
				- agreed that it could be another solution
				- need to estimate entity loss again
		- [[Jerry Mao]] informed me to join [[Backend Platform/Meeting]] starting next week
		- started working on [[TWHKSRP/3248]]
			- gathered all the titles available in Chinese and English from [[Wikidata]]
