# Daily Log
	- ## Midnight
		- 23:57 #[[Bed Time]]
	- ## Morning
		- 05:39 #[[Wake Time]]
		- [[Uni/Sprint Planning]]
			- got assigned two new tasks
				- check [[Byfor]] is still working in [[Uni]] bare metal and [[Omega]]
				- remove legacy code about reading country woeid for private search and AOL
			- I will do the [[Uni/Release]] on [[2023-04-13 Thursday]]
				- [[Mingmin Bai]] merged her [[Pull Request]], make sure the regression test for configuration pass
		- studied [[Byfor]] #Uni
			- it's a [[DNS]] resolver
				- install on [[Uni]] hosts, so that it doesn't need to make request to [[DNS]] server for every domain name
			- check the [[GitHub Enterprise]] repo
			- there's a log under `/home/y/logs/uni_server/byfor.log`
				- it contains lots of errors for resolving domain name
				- need to study `c-ares` library to understand the error message
		- [[PI/Standup]]
	- ## Afternoon
		- [[Mingmin Bai]] left a comment in my [[Pull Request]] for [[Uni/5817]]
			- need to preload the `TldBoundaryDataHandle` with `DataHandleService`
				- the file will be loaded when `uni_server` starts
			- the cached data handle will check for reloading file every 5 minutes
		- [[TW Backend/Sprint Planning]]
			- talked about [[Uni/5817]]
		- kept studying [[Byfor]] and `c-ares` #Uni
			- the error messages only show there's no [[DNS]] record for the requested domain, still need to understand how [[Byfor]] actually work
		- generate a new tag for [[Uni/Release]]
			- the pipeline failed at `tag-qa`
				- failed to pull the image
				- succeeded after restarting the job
			- it failed again at `launch-stg`
				- asked [[Kevin Hsu]] to check
				- only a temporary network issue, succeeded after restarting the job
				- for non-prod [[ScrewDriver]] jobs, we can rerun it first
