# Daily Log
	- ## Midnight
		- 00:12 #[[Bed Time]]
	- ## Morning
		- 05:44 #[[Wake Time]]
		- [[Uni/Taiwan Sync]]
			- need to verify [[Uni/5928]] changes after [[Uni/Release]]
		- [[Allen Hsieh]] asked about [[Sherlock]] [[Jira/API]] migration
			- currently [[Sherlock]] can't file a ticket
			- need to get the `accountId` of the reporter and assignee
		- [[TW Backend/Standup]]
	- ## Afternoon
		- worked on [[Uni/5884]]
			- [[Uni]] applied RTBF filter on image result two times
				- [[Uni/GConf]] result and `BingSearchResponseParser` result
			- needed to consider how to write the [[Uni/GConf]] parsing config file, so if we need to support more modules in the future, they can share the same function
		- [[Trinity Wong]] asked me to verify [[Uni/5928]] after [[Uni/Release]]
			- I can't see the result using production hosts
			- the request can actually get the response, but the browser can't render it
			- the response [[XML]] seems valid
			- tested new parameters with production request succeeded
			- tried using mobile production request, also succeeded
			- the error appeared from time to time
			- [[Trinity Wong]] pointed out the error may be caused by an invalid character in [[Uni]] response
			- there're too many ads in the north region, so the character to represent the number of ads became invalid
			- posted a message in [[Slack]] about this error
		- [[Allen Hsieh]] reported the adult monitoring script stuck #Sherlock
			- restarted the job
				- it picked up the input file successfully
			- it was caused by the certificate issue [[Jul 19th, 2023]], and the script didn't release the lock
