			- similar to the questions of ucfunnel's first interview
			- greedy and dp
			- had a small bug in the first question
			- asked how would I test my program
		- second engineer asked technical questions about c++
		  collapsed:: true
			- function parameters, pass by value, pass by reference
			- class, static function, how to correct program
				- answered pretty bad
			- how would I handle strings that may vary without recompiling the program
			- implement a queue
				- using linked list as underlying data structure
				- implement the linked list myself
				- took too long
				- should've ask the detailed requirements

		  title:: Complex Combinational circuits in Bluespec
	- the outputs of a Bluespec program is to describe circuits
	- Bluespec compiler eliminates all constructs which have no direct hardware meaning
	  collapsed:: true
		- also called static elaboration
		- all data structures are converted into bit vectors
		- loops are unfolded
		- functions are in-lined
		- only acyclic graph of Boolean gates remain
	- types
	  collapsed:: true
		- every expression in a Bluespec program has a type
		- a type is a grouping of values
		- a type declaration can be parameterized by other types using the syntax `#`
		- a type name always begins with a capital letter
		- use `typedef` to declare a synonym for a certain type
	- enumerated type
	  collapsed:: true
		- Bluespec compiler automatically assigns a bit representation to the name you provide
		- it also provides a function to test whether two names are equal
	- type checking
	  collapsed:: true
		- Bluespec compiler checks if all the declared types are used consistently
		- use `let` syntax to let the compiler deduct the type for you
