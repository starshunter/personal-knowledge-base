		- tried to deploy a [[Pod]] in staging environment #Uni/6024
			- staging environment doesn't have access to [[AWE Data]]
		- [[Tomek Majchzak]] didn't agree to remove code about parsing old [[Bing]] response format #Uni/6022
			- added code to make sure the old [[Unit Test]] won't fail
			- maintain the current [[Syndi]] output format
	- ## Afternoon
		- for canary, added [[Virtual Service]] and [[Service Entries]] resources to connect to production endpoints #Uni/6024
			- satisfied all the requirements successfully
			- checked how [[SAGW]] rolled out their change
				- start with testing environment
				- use `routing.yaml` to split the traffic between old and new routing method
			- created a [[Pull Request]] to create two [[Pod]] with [[Istio]], and added `routing.yaml` to split the traffic evenly in bf1
