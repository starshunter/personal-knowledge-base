	- ## Afternoon
		- study `node-scheduler`
			- [[Sherlock]]'s new report cannot run once a month, or else if the manual uploaded data missed the scheduled date, the report will not be generated
			- if we schedule the script to run every day, we need a way to detect the data is ready and no other job is processing the data
				- use `async-mutex`
		- write the skeleton of production code
