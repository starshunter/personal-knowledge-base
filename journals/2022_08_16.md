# Daily Log
	- ## Midnight
		- 01:46 #[[Bed Time]]
	- ## Morning
		- 08:14 #[[Wake Time]]
		- did some final testing in dev machine #Sherlock
		- gather notes for [[PI/Standup]]
			- for Sherlock, yesterday I finished changing my code to adopt to the new YDS schema, and I'm currently creating a pvc on the Omega for staging, and after doing some final checks, I think I can create the pr this afternoon
		- asked [[Fox Wu]] about how to remove deployment in `gq1` #Omega #Sherlock
			- he said he doesn't know
			- maybe [[Leon Ku]] could help to redirect `sherlock.corp.yahoo.com` only to `bf1`
		- asked [[Leon Ku]] about `sherlock.corp.yahoo.com` redirection #Sherlock
			- he confirmed it's possible
			- I can still deploy to `gq1`
			- I don't need to change `omega.yaml` or `screwdriver.yaml`
		- `yo/sherlockstg` will only direct to `bf1`
	- ## Afternoon
		- tried to squash git commits, but encountered some problems #Sherlock #Git
			- I should squash first then merge with the master
			- squashed to 20 commits
			- merged with master and resolved merge conflicts
		- created pvc in `bf1` #Omega #Sherlock
			- called `sherlock-pvc-stg`
			- `kubectl get all` won't show it, have to use `kubectl get pvc`
			- bounded successfully
		- create a [[Pull Request]] draft #Sherlock
			- [[ScrewDriver]] cannot install `@next/env`
			- looked up the slack channel `nodejs`, some people had the same problem
			- the artifactory team accidentally removed some packages while fixing a security bug
