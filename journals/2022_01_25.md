	- combining bonds and equities may limit the upside of returns, but it can also reduce volatility by diversifying risks
	- author use 60/40 (equities/bonds) ratio to backtest performance, see page 152 for graph
- [[The Long Good Buy/Chapter 3]]
	- market cycles tend to move in relation with business cycles, because valuation is affected by companies future fundamental
	- recognize different phases of investment cycles exist can help us identify possible shift of returns and signs to look for
	- four phases of market cycles
		- the despair phase
			- bear market, peak to low, market expect macroeconomics to be worse
			- driven by falling valuations, result in P/E decline
			- earnings are still rising but prices drop sharply
		- the hope phase
			- short period, rebounding
			- driven by anticipation of trough in economic cycle, thus higher future profit growth prediction, also trailing P/E ratio
			- highest future returns, but data of macroeconomics is still weak, one possible way to identify it is the rate of deteriorating start to slow down
			- investors start to anticipate the end of recession, accept lower future expected returns(ERP declines), volatility starts to drop at the end of the phase
		- the growth phase
			- longest period, earning growth actually happens
			- returns realized in hope phase, but not earnings growth, valuation is back to normal once growth beats returns
			- higher yield in bond markets can also be the driver
		- the optimism phase
			- investors become too confident, valuations exceed earning growth, result in next correction
			- FOMO drives returns over growth, resulting in lower expected future returns, higher volatility
	- earning growth generate profits in hope phase and optimism phase, not when it occurs
	- returns from different phase from high to low: hope, optimism, growth, despair
	- actual profit growth and returns are not synchronized, because investors tend to pay forward for expected growth
	- valuation expands most in hope and optimism phase

	- story line was better than I expected
	- plot reversion at the end is intriguing
	- main character's personality is a bit annoying
	- DONE ED Another Day Goes By, is dope, definitely need to add it to playlist

- learn some tips using logseq #Logseq/Concept
	- avoid using links notoriously inside the information, which result in chaotic graph, add related tags at the end instead
		- kind of like initial processing of information
	- three levels of content
		- data
			- plain text or wiki
		- information
			- data add some context(tags)
		- knowledge
			- combining different information and form an unique insight
	- layout the structure of your database in contents page
- # Afternoon
- [[LeetCode Daily Challenge/2022-01]] #Array
	- problem:: Valid Mountain Array
	  link:: https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-mountain-array/
	  difficulty:: Easy 
	  duration:: 5 mins
	- second time solving it
	- very similar to [yesterday's challenge](((61ef77e9-7027-4ca0-b941-a02136a75ee9))), so quite straightforward, solve within 5 mins
	- miss an edge case, so WA once

	- `if-else` statement
		- basic syntax #Golang/Syntax
			- ```golang
			  if <boolean expression> {
			  	<code>
			  }
			  ```
			- ```golang
			  if <boolean expression> {
			  	<code_1>
			  }
			  else {
			  	<code_2>
			  }
			  ```
			- ```golang
			  if <boolean expression 1> {
			  	<code_1>
			  } else if <boolean expression 2> {
			  	<code_2>
			  } else if <boolean expression 3> {
			  	<code_3>
			  } else {
			  	<code_4>
			  }
			  ```
		- assigning initial value in `if`
			- ```golang
			  if <init statement>; <boolean expression> {
			  	<code>
			  }
			  ```
			- cannot use `var` to declare variable in `<init statement>`, only short variable declaration is available
	- `switch` statement
		- basic syntax #Golang/Syntax
			- ```golang
			  switch <init statement>; <expression> {
			  case <expression>:
			  	<code>
			  case <expression>, <expression>:
			  	<code>
			      fallthrough
			  default:
			  	<code>
			  }
			  ```
			- `<init statement>` and `<expression>` in the first line are not necessary
				- <expression> doesn't necessary need to be `<boolean expression>`
				- `switch` statement without `expression` has same effect as `switch true`
		- once the compiler find a match in `case`, it will execute the code inside that `case`, and leave the `switch` statement
		- thus, if we want to execute every case that satisfy the condition, we need to add `fallthrough` at the end of `case`
			- `fallthrough` will transfer control to the first statement in the next `case`
			- `fallthrough` cannot be used at final `case` or `default`
	- `for` loop
		- basic syntax #Golang/Syntax
			- ```golang
			  for <init statement>; <conditional statement>; <end statement> {
			  	<code>
			  }
			  ```
				- `<conditional statement>` will check the condition before the loop execute
				- `<end statement>` will run after the loop execute
			- ```golang
			  for {
			  	<code>
			  }
			  ```
				- an infinite loop, unless the break from the inside `<code>`
			- ```golang
			  for <conditional statement> {
			  	<code>
			  }
			  ```
			- ```golang
			  for <key>, <value> := range <set> {
			  	<code>
			  }
			  ```
				- normally use to iterate unordered, unknown length container, like `map`
				- `range` will decide when to end the loop
				- when using `range` to iterate `array` or `slice`, cannot modify value through `<value>`, because it's just a copy
		- `break` and `continue`
			- work just like `break` and `continue` in other languages
- learn some PKM with logseq #Logseq/Concept #PKM
	- what do I want to achieve by writing done literally every thought each day
		- watch how I grow by watching my thought process on some general topics
		- derive and combine useful information from cluster of thoughts and use these information to help me get better
		- share my insight on certain topics with others
	- the point of midnight
		- technology advance faster than our learning rate
		- amount of information grow faster than our ability to consume and process
	- remove noise, sometimes less is better
	- you don't need to consume or capture everything
	- output is as important as input
	- don't let possible imperfection stops you from doing something, any achievement is better than nothing #Quote
	- have different stacks to work with, depending on my condition to choose what I want to do
	- four phases of digital knowledge
		- capturing
			- pages
				- long articles
				- books
				- courses
			- journal
				- podcasts, videos, tweets
		- idea generation
			- personal thinking
			- building on what others have said
		- processing
		- output
	- don't backlink every word
	- don't try to find home for every content, leave it in the source
- learn Zettelkasten with logseq #Logseq/Zettelkasten #PKM #Zettelkasten
	- just in time vs. just in case
		- deadline driven vs. no clear deadline
		- pre-defined vs. emerges
		- directed vs. flows
		- linear and predictable vs. non-linear
	- principles
		- atomicity of notes
		- clear relationships between notes
		- clear separation of input and output
	- sequencing and branching
