- [[The Go Workshop/Encoding and Decoding]] #Golang/JSON
	- decoding JSON as go struct
		- use `Unmarshal()` to decode
			- `func Unmarshal(data []byte, v interface{}) error` #Golang/Syntax
			- the field of the struct need to be exportable for successful decoding
		- add JSON tag to struct
			- the tag need to match the key inside JSON data
			- `Unmarshal()` will decode JSON into struct base on two rules
				- an exportable field has a JSON tag corresponding to a JSON field
				- an exportable field has field name corresponding to a JSON field
		- decode JSON to composite struct
			- composite JSON need to be decoded into composite struct
	- encoding go struct into JSON
		- use `Marshal()` to encode
			- `func Marshal(v interface{}) ([]byte, error)` #Golang/Syntax
			- rules to generate JSON while using `Marshal()`
				- only exportable fields will be encoded
				- only fields with JSON tag will be encoded
				- if there is only one field in the input struct, than it will be encoded regardless it has JSON tag or not
				- if input struct has multiple fields but has no JSON tag, then all fields will be ignored
			- if some fields have JSON tag but have no value, then `Marshal()` will assign zero values to these field
		- omit field
			- if you want to omit fields with zero value, add `omitempty` JSON tag
			- if you want to omit fields directly, add `-` JSON tag
			- fields with empty JSON tag will be encoded to JSON with the struct's field name
		- use `MarshalIndent` to output more readable JSON string
			- `func MarshalIndent(v interface{}, prefix, indent string) ([]byte, error)`
	- use Decoder/Encoder to process JSON data
		- we can use `newDecoder()` and `newEncoder()` to create decoder and encoder #Golang/Syntax
			- `func newDecoder(r io.Reader) *Decoder`
			- `func newEncoder(w io.Writer) *Encoder`
		- the created decoder will decode data from the source of our choice
		- the created encoder will encode data and write it into the destination of our choice
	- handle unknown JSON data
		- sometimes the values inside JSON data can be unknown or change frequently
			- using struct to decode/encode is unrealistic
		- we can use `map[string]interface{}` to catch decoded JSON data
		- use type assertion to determine type of each field later if necessary
		- when encoding a map to JSON, JSON's field names will be map's key names
	- gob
		- gob is golang's own binary encoding format
		- better communication efficiency between go programs
		- use `newDecoder()/newEncoder()` to create decoder/encoder

	  title:: Chapter 6: The Link Layer and LANs
	- link layer
		- responsible for transferring datagram from one node to physically adjacent node over a link
		- different link protocol may provide different services
			- framing, link access
				- encapsulate datagram
				- MAC address to identify source and destination
			- reliable delivery
			- flow control
			- error detection
			- error correction
			- half duplex and full duplex
				- both side can or cannot send at the same time
		- link layer is implemented in every host's adaptor
	- error detection
		- attach error detection and correction bits to the frame
		- parity checking
			- add bit at the end to make number of 1 even or odd
			- single bit parity or two dimensional bit parity
		- cyclic redundancy check
			- more powerful
			- suppose data represent in binary is D, then choose bit patter G with length r + 1, we want to attach r bits R to the end of D, which make D + R is divisible by G
	- multiple access protocols
		- single shared broadcast channel but with two or more simultaneous transmissions
		- need a distributed algorithm to determine how should nodes share the channel
			- and the algorithm uses this shared channel to communicate
		- goals
			- when one node want to transmit, it can transmit at rate R
			- when M nodes want to transmit, each of them can send at rate R/M
			- fully decentralized
			- simple
		- three types of protocol
			- channel partitioning
				- TDMA
					- divide channel by time
					- each node get certain slot in every round
				- FDMA
					- divide channel by frequency
					- each node get certain frequency for transmission
			- random access
				- node can transmit at full rate whenever it wants to transmit
				- collision occurs when two or more nodes transmit
				- protocol should specify how to detect and recover from collision
				- slotted ALOHA
					- assume all frame has same size
					- divide channel by time into slots
					- node can only transmit at slot beginning
					- when collision detected, each node retransmits with probability p in subsequent slots until success
					- 37% channel usage
				- ALOHA
					- no synchronization needed
					- efficiency worse than slotted ALOHA
				- CSMA
					- listen before transmit
					- transmit entire frame only if channel is idle
					- collision can still occur because of propagation delay
				- CSMA/CD
					- detect if there is another transmission while transmitting
					- colliding transmissions aborted and enter binary backoff
					- efficiency better than ALOHA
				- CSMA/CA
			- taking turns
				- polling
					- master node makes decision
					- may have single point of failure, polling overhead concerns
				- token passing
					- a token is passed around to allow node to transmit
					- may have single point of failure, token overhead concerns
				-
	- LAN
		- MAC address
			- 48 bit
			- used to get frame from one interface to another interface under same network
			- portable, unlike IP address
		- ARP
			- address resolution protocol
			- determine interface's MAC address given its IP address
			- ARP table stores IP/MAC address pairs
			- broadcast ARP query to get another interface's MAC address
			- ((61ffdcb4-d0a4-438b-93f9-0558e75f554b))
			  ((61ffdcc4-a7a9-4e99-975b-442f49e06190))
			-
		- Ethernet
			- wired LAN technology
			- physical topology
				- bus
					- may collide
				- star
					- each node attach to a switch
			- frame structure
				- preamble
					- synchronize purpose
				- destination MAC address
				- type
				- CRC
			- unreliable and connectionless
				- no handshake needed
				- no reliable data transfer
				- use CSMA/CD
		- switch
			- store and forward frames
			- full duplex
			- has a switch table, record MAC address and interface mapping
			- switch learns host's location through incoming frame
			- if destination of incoming frame is unknown, than switch will forward it to every interface except the incoming one
		- VLAN
			- define multiple virtual LANs over single physical LAN infrastructure
			- port-based VLAN
				- traffic isolation
				- dynamic membership
				- forwarding between VLANs
			- trunk port
				- carries frames between VLANs defined over multiple physical switches
