	- problem:: Smallest String With A Given Numeric Value
	  link:: https://leetcode.com/problems/smallest-string-with-a-given-numeric-value/
	  difficulty:: Medium
	  duration:: 20 mins
	- first time solving this problem
	- first solved it with recursion, but the performance was very bad
	- construct the string by appending a first, until the remaining k cannot be fulfilled by n characters
	- append the appropriate character, then concatenate remaining z
	- we can first construct a string with all characters as a, then change each character

		- on a write hit
			- write-back policy will only write to cache and update the next level memory when the line is evicted
			- write-through policy will write both the cache and the next level memory
		- on a write miss
			- allocate will first fetch the line, and then update a word in it
			- no allocate will not affect the cache, the store is forwarded to memory
	- replacement policy
	  collapsed:: true
		- direct mapped cache has no choice
		- n-way set-associative cache
			- n choices for line to replace
			- LRU is most common
	- cache performance
	  collapsed:: true
		- cache designs have many parameters
			- cache size
			- line size
			- degree of associativity
			- replacement policy
		- use the number of cache hits of a given set of cache parameters on a given set of memory reference sequences to evaluate cache performance
	- blocking vs. non-blocking cache
	  collapsed:: true
		- blocking
			- at most one outstanding miss
			- cache must wait for memory to respond
			- cache does not accept processor requests in the meantime
		- non-blocking
			- multiple outstanding misses
			- cache can continue to process requests while waiting for memory to respond to misses
