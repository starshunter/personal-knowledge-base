		- gather notes for [[PI/Standup]]
			- for Sherlock, yesterday I was using a subset of the input data to test my method of excluding unqualified links from HLFS response, and after running the test for several rounds and adjusting my method according to the output, the result is pretty good, almost no outgoing links are left in the response, so today I will start to write the script using two level crawling to generate sherlock's report, then run the script and compare the result to the old method to see how much is the improvement using two level crawling

	- ## Afternoon
		- DONE ask [[MIT Team]] if they can make sure the column names of input data stay the same
		- [[Clement Staff Meeting]]
			- [[Clement Lee]] said I will be working on [[Uni]]
		- rewrote some code to make it more readable #Sherlock
