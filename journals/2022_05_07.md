		  collapsed:: true
			- we must understand the model behind git to master git
			- git is a distributed revision control system
			- at its core, git is a persistent map that maps keys to values
			  collapsed:: true
				- value is a sequence of bytes representing the files, and the hash of that sequence is the key
				- every object in git has its own SHA1
				- we don't need to worry two files have the same hash
				- `git hash-object` can get the hash of a file
				- git directory is in `.git`
				  collapsed:: true
					- git saves all the object inside `objects/`
					- files are stored as blobs in `objects/`
					  collapsed:: true
						- blobs represent the content of the files
					- a git commit is stored as commit in `objects/`
					  collapsed:: true
						- it points to a tree which represents the repository
						- if it's not the first commit, then it also points to parent which represents its last commit
				- git doesn't store the same object two times
			- annotated tags are tags that carry additional information point to commits
			- four types of git objects reside in `.git/objects`
			  collapsed:: true
				- blobs
				- trees
				- commits
				- annotated tags
			- git is like a high level file system consider how it stores objects
			- git stores branches information in `.git/refs`
				- a branch is just a reference to a commit
				- `HEAD` by default is a reference to a branch
					- a branch, not a commit
			- switching a branch means the `HEAD` is referencing to a different branch, and the working directory is replaced by that branch
				- a branch tracks the newest commit, and every commit points to a tree representing the status of the repository
				- by moving `HEAD` between commit, git restores working directory by referencing to the tree structure
			- git merge creates a new commits points to two commits
			- we can checkout a commit
				- it points directly to a commit and creates a detached head
				- we only move `HEAD` while committing if we have a detached head
			- unreachable objects can be garbage collected
