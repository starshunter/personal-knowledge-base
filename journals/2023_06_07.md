		- [[Jasmine Basci]] reported a bug in [[Sherlock]]
			- adult monitoring violations were missing in production
				- it was caused by null `rollup_status`
				- the way I get current timestamp for adult monitoring was incorrect
					- should separate adult monitoring violations from other violations when doing so
				- created [[Pull Request]] to fix the bug
					- also needed create one for [[YDS]] since changes for new violations were already in the branch
					- [[Fox Wu]] approved it
						- he suggested I should refactor the [[SQL]] query to make it manageable
		- [[PI/Standup]]
		- the bug was fix #Sherlock
			- [[MIT]] also wanted the new violations in production
				- asked them to check in staging first
			- send an email to notify them
	- ## Afternoon
		- studied market redefinition for [[Uni/5911]]
			- looks `uni_atlas` is used by [[Uni/SBL]] server
				- the [[Syndi]] request coming to [[Uni]] should have `enableAtlas=1` in it
			- removing the market entry means not redefining the ad market for those country
			- this should only affect [[Syndi]] request
				- created a [[Pull Request]]
				- also need to update package version
				- the market redefinition for [[Yahoo/O&O]] is done in [[Uni]], using `market_redef` library
		- [[MingMin Bai]] replied to my question in [[Jira]] ticket #Uni/5885
			- proposed to not only check emitter initialization, but also try sending a event through the emitter to check for configuration error
