# Daily Log
	- ## Midnight
		- 11:43 #[[Bed Time]]
	- ## Morning
		- 05:45 #[[Bed Time]]
		- test the built package #Uni/5754
			- it will use default bucket logic even the `Galileo` headers are valid
		- clean up the code of [[Statslite]] query #Statslite/Migration
		- [[PI/Sprint Planning]]
			- [[Clement Lee]] said we don't need to consider too many parameters for the query now, we should focus on running the query through [[PI/Middleware]]
		- fixed headers being override by default bucket logic #Uni/5754
			- added conditions in the two methods, check if `enApolloMultiLayer` is enabled
	- ## Afternoon
		- [[Meeting]] with [[Chih-Yu Ko]] and [[Trinity Wong]] to talk about [[Statslite/Migration]]
			- check on the current status
			- [[Chih-Yu Ko]] asked me to submit the code I wrote
			- he also said I can try connecting middleware to the grid if I have time
		- [[Trinity Wong]] gave me some advice on how to connect [[PI/Middleware]] to the [[Yahoo Grid]] #Statslite/Migration
		- created [[Pull Request]] for [[Uni/5754]]
		- tried to send a request to trigger the API in [[PI/Local Report]] #Statslite/Migration
			- it can't connect to [[PI/Database]]
			- [[Trinity Wong]] told me how to resolve this error
			- still can't connect after rerunning the bootstrap script
