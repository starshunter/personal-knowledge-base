# Daily Log
	- ## Midnight
		- 02:34 #[[Bed Time]]
	- ## Morning
		- 08:22 #[[Wake Time]]
		- gather notes for [[PI/Standup]]
			- for me, yesterday I was checking my access to HLFS, I can access the verification endpoint they provide and get the correct response, but when I tried to use it in my script, I kept getting an error saying my access is forbidden, I double check the steps I have done but still couldn't resolve this issue, so I'm asking for some advice in slack channel now
			- also yesterday I tried to modify the frontend code of the PI dashboard, and I can add the fast type report to the ETL tab, so today I will study how to get the fast type report data from the database
		- [[PI/Standup]]
		- [[HLFS]] team confirmed they forgot to add the [[Athenz]] role to their config file #Sherlock
			- they merged the [[Pull Request]]
			- I confirmed I can access the endpoint
	- ## Afternoon
		- tried to figure out how to connect to [[PI/Database]] #[[PI/Dashboard]]
			- [[Fox Wu]] told me only [[Jack Chiang]] has the password of the production database
			- I could use SQL developer to connect to staging database
			- need to install Oracle [[JDK]]
		- tried to run the testing script using [[HLFS]] #Sherlock
			- couldn't decode the response
			- the response data is a string
			- need to add `responseType: arraybuffer` to [[Axios]] options
	- ## Night
		- used [[HLFS]] to crawl some websites #Sherlock
			- the `<img>` elements are wrapped very deep
			- it can only crawl `<img>`, but some images are set as background image
				- DONE need to discuss this with [[MIT Team]]
