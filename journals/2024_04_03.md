		- merged [[Uni/6440]] [[Pull Request]]
		- studied [[YK Data Pipeline]]
			- the extractor is a package
				- it does all the work, include dumping the data from [[Wikipedia]], extract the data through [[MediaWiki]] API
			- another package on feed host will merge TW and HK output into one [[Data Pack]]
			- not sure what data is store in [[MYSQL]]
				- successfully generate [[SQL]] file from data dump
				- there are several other dump, include one from [[DBpedia]]
			- not sure how the data is extracted and transformed
				- it's [[Python]] code
				- need to understand to be able to tell what's the difference between this pipeline and US pipeline
			- also studied some US pipeline
				- there's one extract pipeline that extracts plain text in wiki pages
					- it supports Chinese
				- still trying to figure out the rest of the stack
