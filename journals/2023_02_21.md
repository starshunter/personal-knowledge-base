# Daily Log
	- ## Midnight
		- 00:07 #[[Bed Time]]
	- ## Morning
		- 05:44 #[[Wake Time]]
		- studied how [[PBob]] makes request to [[PI/Middleware]] #YPI/1660
			- it's using `pmcWebService`
			- will need to change the request url
		- [[PI/Standup]]
		- [[Chih-Yu Ko]] asked me about his problem #Statslite/Migration
			- there's a typo
		- [[MingMin Bai]] wanted me to confirm a case #Uni/5754
			- she got the header name wrong
			- she merged the [[Pull Request]]
	- ## Afternoon
		- use `mvn compile` to build [[PI/Middleware]] #Statslite/Migration
			- need to added a `settings.xml` file to `~/.m2` to find the dependencies
