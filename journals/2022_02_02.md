	  title:: Chapter 3: Transport Layer
	- transport layer services
		- provide communication services between two processes on different host
		- runs in end systems, breaks messages into segments and reassembles
		- Internet transport layer protocol
			- TCP
			- UDP
			- doesn't guarantee delay and bandwidth
	- multiplexing and demultiplexing
		- two bidirectional process
		- transport layer gathers data from different socket, and add transport layer header to form segments, than push these segments into network layer, this is multiplexing,  and demultiplexing means the reverse process, where transport layer remove the header, and send each data to correct socket
		- transport layer header contains source port and destination port, which are used for demultiplexing
		- UDP demultiplexing
			- since UDP is connectionless, segment with same port but different source IP or port will be sent to same socket
		- TCP demultiplexing
			- TCP use (source IP, source port, destination IP, destination port, protocol) to identify which socket to send to
	- UDP
		- best effort service, may be lost or out of order
		- connectionless, so no handshake is needed
		- reliability is added at application layer
		- no congestion control, so sender can send segment at will
	- reliable data transfer
		- achieve reliability over unreliable channel
		- four major components
			- rdt_send()
				- application layer call this function to send data
			- udt_send()
				- transport layer call this function to send data over unreliable channel
			- rdt_rcv()
				- transport layer call this function to receive data from unreliable channel
			- deliver_data()
				- transport layer call this function to send data to application layer
		- rdt 1.0
			- transfer over reliable channel
			- no extra work is needed
		- rdt 2.0
			- underlying cannel may flip bits
			- checksum can detect errors
			- use ACKs and NAKs to recover from the error
				- if receiver detect no error, than send ACK back to sender, otherwise send NAK
				- ((61fa4fcc-f0ca-4f8e-a966-bf2f92891fa9))
		- rdt 2.1
			- in rdt 2.0, the protocol can't handle situation where ACK/NAK is corrupted
			- if the sender retransmit every it receive a corrupted ACK/NAK, receiver may receive duplicated packet, causing further problem
			- add sequence number to every packet we send, so that receiver can detect which packet is duplicate, and should discard it and send ACK/NAK
			- sender
			  ((61fa5f7d-2589-4785-b4c8-f61219e07d68))
				- in rdt 2.1, ACK/NAK don't need to distinguish by sequence number
			- receiver
			  ((61fa5fba-7077-4d78-bdac-1174f1928b83))
				- receiver now has two state, wait for sequence number 1 or 0, receiver resend ACK/NAK once receive a corrupted packet or packet with wrong sequence number
		- rdt 2.2
			- same functionality as rdt 2.1 but only use ACKs as receiver's respond
			- add sequence number to ACK, indicate which packet is received and uncorrupted
		- rdt 3.0
			- underlying channel may lose packet
			- add timer at sender side, if no ACK received, than retransmit last packet
			- receiver may get duplicated packet and retransmit ACK, but like rdt 2.2, it can be resolved by the sequence number on ACK
			- ((61fa6c11-f97b-4e2d-8ac9-99b7109b238d))
			  ((61fa6c24-7970-4d9b-95a0-d0b6176f5cdb))
			- the performance of rdt 3.0 isn't quite good
				- because sender need to receive ACK to send next packet
		- pipelined protocols
			- increase network utilization
			- sender can send multiple packets without receiving corresponding ACKs
			- sequence number should increase along with each packet sent
		- sliding window protocols
			- sender maintain a range of sequence numbers, indicate how many packets it can send
			- receiver also maintain a window, indicate which packets it can accept
			- go-back-N
				- sender can send up to N unACKed packet
				- receiver sends cumulative ACK to indicate it receive up to which packet
				- sender places a timer on the oldest unACKed packet, once the timer goes off, it resend every unACKed packets
			- selective repeat
				- sender can send up to N unACKed packet
				- receiver sends ACK for each received packet
				- sender places a timer on every unACKed packet, once the timer goes off, it resend that individual packet
			- both protocols don't require sender to react to duplicated ACK, just wait until the timer goes off

- [[The Go Workshop/Errors]] #Golang/Errors
	- three types of error
		- syntax errors
			- result from unfamiliar with the programming language
		- runtime errors
			- appear at runtime
		- logic errors
			- hardest to resolve
	- error interface
		- error is a value in go
			- it can be passed around, read and compared
			- the following is the error interface in go
			  ```golang
			  type error interface {
			  	Error() string
			  }
			  ```
				- any type that has a method called `Error()`, and that method return a `string` is an error type
		- define error value
			- we can use `errors.New(<string>)` to create our own error value
				- `errors.New()` return a pointer of `errorString`, which implement the error interface
				- ```golang
				  type errorStrings struct {
				  	s string
				  }
				  
				  func (e *errorString) Error() string {
				  	return e.s
				  }
				  ```
			- the custom error value in go normally start with `Err`
			- we can also use `fmt.Errorf()` to create our error value
				- `fmt.Errorf("%w", <wrapped error>)` can create a wrap error, which has a field `err` that allow us to access the wrapped error
				- we can use wrap error to pass error to upper scale and don't need to worry losing the detail of the wrapped error
		-
	- panic
		- error is just a value, so if we don't specifically tell the program how to deal with error, it won't stop the program
		- but if something really severe occur, than go will invoke a `panic`, it will keep passing to upper scale, and finally, if you don't handle it, cause the entire program to stop
		- `panic` is to protect the integrity of the program
		- although `panic()` can receive any type of input, the convention is to pass an error value into it
		- procedure after a panic occur
			- program stop
			- if the function which panic occurs in has deferred functions, those functions will be called
			- panic pass to upper function and repeat last step until we reach `main()`
			- statements after `panic()` won't execute
			- program crash
	- recover
		- `recover()` can be used to regain control of the program
		- `recover()` can only be used in deferred function
			- `recover()` resume current function, but can avoid `panic()` being passed to upper function
		- use `r := recover()` to catch the panic
	- principles dealing with error and panic
		- use `Err` at front when we declare our own error value, and use camel case
		- error message should start with lowercase, and don't add punctuation at the end
		- we should always check the error value if the function return one
		- pass error value into `panic()`
		- don't compare the string content inside an error
		- use `panic()` wisely
