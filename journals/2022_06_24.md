		- figured out how to add PVC to [[Omega]] cluster #Sherlock
			- the correct cluster is `omega.prod1.corp.gq1`
		- gather notes for [[PI/Standup]]
			- yesterday I finished the new home page for Sherlock, and I also rewrote some code to use partner information in the database, so the script doesn't need to create new partners anymore, and UI can show more details about a violation, and now I'm working on a simple upload page, it can take the input data uploaded by users and extract necessary columns and write them into PVC

	- ## Afternoon
		- redesigned the home page #Sherlock
			- added a preview of search policy violation table
			- embedded upload page
