- access level modifiers are a little different from [[C++]] in [[Java]] #[[Access Modifier]]
  collapsed:: true

	- in C++, no modifier fields or methods are default to private
	- in Java, no modifier is default to package-private
		- classes in the same package can use the fields or methods
	- also notice that subclass in different package can use protected fields or methods
- in [[Java]], a [[Static Nested Class]] can access its enclosing class's static field, but not cannot access instance members
- [[Inner Class]] cannot have static member except for static constant variable #Java
- [[Inner Class]] and [[Static Nested Class]] have different ways of instantiation #Java
  collapsed:: true
	- we must instantiate outer class before instantiating inner class
		- ```java
		  OuterClass outerObject = new OuterClass();
		  OuterClass.InnerClass innerObject = outerObject.new InnerClass();
		  ```
		- or, in outer class method
		  ```java
		  this.new InnerClass()
		  ```
	- we can directly instantiate static nested class
		- ```java
		  StaticNestedClass staticNestedObject = new StaticNestedClass();
		  ```
- if a member of the [[Inner Class]] shadows another member of the enclosing class, then we can access the shadowed member using class name plus keyword `this` #Java
