		- [[YongMing Liu]] asked about a missing field
			- had a quick call with him
			- he needed a intent field
			- it's a misunderstanding caused by the type of ad
		- [[Fox Wu]] said I could demo [[PBob]] new feature in [[PI/Sprint Planning]]
		- [[PI/Sprint Planning]]
			- demoed the [[PBob]] new feature
			- [[Clement Lee]] asked about the behavior if the user change the selected labels
			- [[Fox Wu]] asked about what would happen if the user change the chart metric
		- asked [[Chih-Yu Ko]] about the occasionally error in staging [[PBob]]
			- he also had no idea
	- ## Afternoon
		- [[Fox Wu]] suggested me to create a new [[Jira]] ticket to track the progress and ask for help
