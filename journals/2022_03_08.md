	- problem:: Linked List Cycle
	  link:: https://leetcode.com/problems/linked-list-cycle/
	  difficulty:: Easy
	  duration:: 20 mins
	- second time solving this problem
	- easy to solve with two pointers
	- try to be clean when handling loop termination condition, but that part is a little bit tricky
