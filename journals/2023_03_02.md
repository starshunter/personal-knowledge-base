	- ## Morning
		- 05:50 #[[Wake Time]]
		- discussed [[Uni/5792]] with [[Ugur Celik]] and [[Miguel Lopez]] #Meeting
			- explained what I have concern about
			- add another field to log `_type`
			- they also wanted to have a field to indicate whether `headerSection` is in the extension
		- [[Uni/Meeting]]
			- told them I will be [[OOO]] for next two weeks
		- [[PI/Standup]]
		- implemented [[Uni/5792]]
			- because now an extension need to log 4 fields, need to change the data structure to a vector of unordered map
			- need to change the way of accessing the container
	- ## Afternoon
		- build and test [[Uni/5892]]
			- no problem about [[Unit Test]]
			- [[Functional Test]] was ok
			- reopened the [[Pull Request]] and updated the comment
