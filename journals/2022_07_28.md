		- gather notes for [[PI/Standup]]
			- for me, I'm still working on displaying inaccessible images to users and ask them for manual review, now I can display the urls in the UI, but I think I also need to add an option for the users to let them classify the image after they done their review, because without this feature, the same set of inaccessible images will appear again and again every month asking for review, and letting users update their judgement of an image can avoid this, so I will start writing this feature today
		- [[PI/Standup]]
		- improved error handling in the script #Sherlock
	- ## Afternoon
		- started to add changing image status feature to the UI #Sherlock
			- use drop down select
			- when change an image's status, not only the data in the database will change, it will also reflect in the UI immediately
			- not only data in `image_result` need to change, fact data also need to update
				- changing a score of an image may affect fact data across different months
	- ## Night
		- seeing bugs here and there, but unable to reproduce #Sherlock
