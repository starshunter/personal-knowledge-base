- learn the difference between same-site and same-origin #Backend #Learning/Work
	- same-origin
		- origin
			- protocol + hostname + port
		- websites that have the exact same three components are considered as same-origin
		- different subdomains are considered different origin
			- eg: https://www.example.com:443 vs. https://example.com:443
	- same-site
		- site
			- domain before eTLD + eTLD
			- eTLD is effective TLD
				- eTLD like `github.io`, `io` itself cannot be considered as TLD
		- websites that have the exact same two components are considered same-site
	- schemeful same-site
		- add differentiation between `http` and `https` when identify same-site
