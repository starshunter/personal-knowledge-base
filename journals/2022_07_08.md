			- I need to add new report, fast type
			- add fast type last 24 hours in the upper areea
			- add a new drop down report in the lower half
			- it only has hourly report
			- [[Jack Chiang]] will tell me how to get the data
			- DONE I need to study API doc and code
		- gather notes for [[PI/Standup]]
			- yesterday I fixed Sherlock's deployment failure in the staging environment, and I also fixed some issue in the development environment that was caused by the dependencies update, and this morning, [[Fox Wu]] and [[Jack Chiang]] introduced me to [[PI/Dashboard]] and the new report I need to add, so today I plan to study the document and the code of the dashboard first
