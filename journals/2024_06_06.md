		- [[Weilin Ng]] suggested to only add support to layer specify bucket to internal user #Uni/6527
			- [[David Weinman]] thought it's fine
			- still need to define what's internal user
		- [[Meeting]] with [[YK Team]] #TWHKSRP/3254
			- generally approved the proposed solution
			- they are in the middle of migrating description extraction workflow
				- will need to update our design
				- will need [[CAKE Team]] to verify the new method doesn't hurt the quality
	- ## Afternoon
		- [[YK Data Pipeline/Consolidation]]
			- break down the tasks first
			- studied new entity description generation workflow
		- [[Backend Platform/Meeting]]
		- [[Kelly Ke]] confirmed [[CAKE Team]] can help to check description quality #[[YK Data Pipeline/Consolidation]]
