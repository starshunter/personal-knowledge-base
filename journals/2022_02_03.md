	- a little boring and predictable compare to last episode
	- a youtube hid himself inside a haunted house to gain popularity but fail
	- no one is irreplaceable for a work, or the firm would fail to operate, but it is always good to hear "thanks you for your help" after finishing a work #[[Quote]]
- [[DCU/EP3]]
	- wow, really didn't see that coming
	- scale of the main story line just got a lot bigger
	- what exactly does terrorist want
	- who take the captain role of DCU

	- third time solving this problem
	- nothing special, just use a hash table for first two arrays
	- than find the target for last two arrays

	- TCP
		- properties
			- point to point
			- reliable and in-order
			- pipelined
			- buffer at both sides
			- bi-directional data flow in one connection
			- connection-oriented
			- flow control
				- sender won't overwhelm receiver
		- three-way handshake
			- ((61fb4eec-9777-4446-8a4e-c4efa1f779d1))
				- the sequence number along with ACK indicates initial sequence number of sending side
				- the sequence number along with NAK indicates which packet with that sequence number has been received
		- four-way handshake
			- ((61fba195-b76d-4481-ad01-82cf42835b8b))
				- in timed wait period, client will resend ACK if it receive FIN
				- server will close connection once it receive the last ACK
		- sequence number
			- indicate the number of first byte in segment's data
			- when send along with ACK, it tells the receiving end what number of first byte is expected next time
			- ((61fba4d3-f199-41e6-80c7-d55b3989482a))
				- host B tells host A it expects number of first byte as 43 next time it receive packet from host A
		- connection
			- TCP use connection, not just port number, to identify where to send the data
			- use a tuple (source IP, source port, destination IP, destination port, protocol) to define connection
		- reliable data transfer
			- pipelined segments
			- cumulative ACKs
			- use single timer
			- ((61fba6c0-8e3d-408a-af00-7c27915510c8))
		- flow control
			- avoid sending too much packet that flood receiver
			- use RcvWindow field in TCP header to tell sender how much spare space is left
			- the sender should keep the number of unACKed packet less than last received RcvWindow
		- congestion control
			- demand for network bandwidth exceeds actual bandwidth, and this situation lasts for a certain period of time
			- end-to-end congestion control
				- end-system figure the severity of congestion by itself through loss and delay
				- used by TCP
			- network-assisted congestion control
				- routers provide feedback to end systems
			- slow start
				- increase rate exponentially until first packet loss
				- enter slow start when a connection begins or after a timeout
				- increase congestion window by one for every packet received
			- congestion avoidance
				- congestion is indicated by a timeout or receiving three duplicated ACKs
				- once the congestion window reaches slow start threshold, increment congestion window slowly
				- 3 duplicate ACKs
					- indicates packet lost
					- fast retransmit
						- reset congestion window and cut slow start threshold by to half of current congestion window
						- goes to slow start phase
						- TCP Tahoe
					- fast recovery
						- after the retransmission, don't reset congestion window, and increment congest window by one for every ACK received
						- TCP Reno
		- competition between TCP and UDP
			- if the sender send data with TCP and UDP at the same time, TCP congestion control will throttle itself, and UDP will get most of the throughput
			- multimedia applications use UDP to avoid this

- [[The Go Workshop/Interfaces]] #[[Golang/Interface]]
	- syntax #[[Golang/Syntax]]
		- ```golang
		  type <name> interface {
		  	<method 1 signature>
		      <method 2 signature>
		  }
		  ```
	- interface in go includes a set of method signatures, if a type define this identical set of methods, we say that type implement the interface, and can be treated like that interface
	- implementation in go is implicit, doesn't require any keyword, just need to bind all the methods specified by interface
		- duck typing
	- a type can implement multiple interfaces at the same time
	- polymorphism
		- an object can be represented in many different forms
	- functions return interface
		- don't do it unless it's necessary
		- interface definition should be simple
		- define concrete type before defining interface
	- empty interface
		- any type in go automatically implement empty interface
	- type assertion
		- {{embed ((61f542da-537c-4991-b080-898add78081a))}}
		- type assertion allows you to check and access underlying type behind interface
	- type switch
		- {{embed ((61f542da-86e4-401e-9c2e-17133686f92a))}}
		- avoid multiple type assertion
