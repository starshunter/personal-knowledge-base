		- 05:33 #[[Wake Time]]
		- [[Uni/Standup]]
			- got assigned to [[Uni/6536]]
			- [[MingMin Bai]] suggested to use `HttpRemoteIp` to implement [[Uni/6527]]
		- [[Simon Turnbridge]] suggested some action for our next steps #[[YK Data Pipeline/Consolidation]]
			- most development can start at local
		- studied [[Uni/6527]]
			- [[Uni]] couldn't get remote host IP in [[Omega]]
				- likely caused by [[Istio]]
	- ## Afternoon
		- [[POC]] for [[Uni/6536]]
		- [[Vinayakumar Kolli]] had a problem about bucket header #Uni
			- we found out their traffic get shift to [[Uni/AWE]]
			- there's a defect when parsing the [[Splunk]] field `X-bt`
				- created [[Uni/6541]]
