		- [[Fox Wu]] told me we should migrate [[Sherlock]] to [[Omega]] prod cluster
			- we should not talk to prod [[YDS]] from corp cluster
		- updated [[Omega]] namespace to add more colos
			- bf1 and gq1
		- applied for new pes role to let [[YDS]] accept connection from prod cluster
		- gather notes for [[PI/Standup]]
			- for Sherlock, about the YDS connection issue, so YDS team said this issue was caused by connecting YDS from different zone, and that Sherlock should be in the production cluster to avoid this issue, so I'm updating the Omega namespace file to use different clusters, and also apply to new pes role to let Sherlock connect to YDS from the new cluster

	- ## Afternoon
		- updated `screwdriver.yaml` and `omega.yaml`
