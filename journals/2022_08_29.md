# Daily Metrics

# Daily Log
	- ## Midnight
		- 02:38 #[[Bed Time]]
	- ## Morning
		- 08:05 #[[Wake Time]]
		- examine the data [[Sieve]] stores in [[HBase]]
			- there're lots of outgoing links in the response, but those contain image url
			- DONE not clear what each column means, need clarification
		- gather notes for [[PI/Standup]]
			- for Sherlock, the job in staging finished executing, and because of the domain blocking problem I mentioned last week, compared to running this job in my dev environment, it only crawled 90% of the total images, so I will wait a few more days before running it again, and for Sieve, I couldn't find what will be the exact format of the response from firehose in their wiki page, but I found a HBASE query tool to query the content Sieve has downloaded, so I will study in this direction today and see what Sieve is capable to do
		- [[PI/Standup]]
	- ## Afternoon
		- studied [[Sieve/Firehose]]
			- the POST request to firehose uses [[Protocol Buffer]] to decode the response
				- it uses length-delimited message for the response
					- `{length}{response}{length}{response}`
					- [[ProtobufJS]] supports `decodeDelimited()`
			- found the repo that stores [[Protocol Buffer]] file
				- `sieve-proto`
			- studied client code
				- the `content` in [[JSON]] response also uses [[Protocol Buffer]] to decode
		- tried to make a stream and used `protobufjs` to decode it
			- failed, problem happened in the content length
			- `protobufjs` couldn't handle number larger than 8 bits
	- ## Night
		- [[石子與羽男/EP7]]
		  collapsed:: true
			- heneo accidently broke a dining car's billboard, so he had to help him to find the person who broke his car before
			- a girl who was chased by a man called haneo for help
			- she fell down from the stairs
			- mifuyu was beaten by her stepfather
			- haneo couldn't find a way to sue the stepfather
			- K was found dead
			- mifuyu broke the car while pretending to be K
			- ishiko used to witness a car accident on her way to the exam
			- they got the video that can prove mifuyu broke the car
			- they won the broken car case
			- they lured the stepfather to admit he had beaten mifuyu
			- mifuyu sued her stepfather
