	- Bluespec repeatedly select any rule that is ready to execute, compute the state updates and make the state updates
	- concurrent execution of rules
		- two rules can execute concurrently if concurrent execution would not cause a double-write error
		- the final state can be obtained by executing rules one-at-a-time in some sequential order
	- efficient hardware for mutirule system requires that many rules execute in parallel without violating the one-rule-at-a-time semantics
