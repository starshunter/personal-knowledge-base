		- [[Uni/Taiwan Sync]]
			- [[Uni/6064]] and [[Uni/6022]] will be released this Thursday
			- released colo by colo for [[Uni/6024]]
		- renamed the [[Istio]] resources in gq1 #Uni/6024
	- ## Afternoon
		- finalized the [[Pull Request]] in both repo #Uni/6024
		- assumed each sentence has one citation and finished an initial implementation #Uni/6020
