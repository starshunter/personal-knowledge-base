# Daily Log
	- ## Midnight
		- 02:40 #[[Bed Time]]
	- ## Morning
		- 08:45 #[[Wake Time]]
		- setup the dev environment for [[PI/Middleware]] again #Statslite/Migration
			- now the error message when making the api call is no access token
		- [[PI/Standup]]
		- [[Fox Wu]] edited the wiki about setting up dev environment #[[PI/Middleware]] #Statslite/Migration
			- cannot bootstrap properly, used previous setting instead
	- ## Afternoon
		- [[Fox Wu]] said we can't make the api call from browser, need to use program to get access token first #Statslite/Migration #PI/Middleware
			- need to create client id and secret in staging [[PI]] first
			- need to modify the b2b url in the program to use uat
			- need to change the api call url to my dev host
			- the request timeout
			- then my request returned permission denied
				- related to IP filtering
				- the client IP in the dev host log is `127.0.0.1` because [[Apache Traffic Server]] will map the request from port 443 to port 8080
