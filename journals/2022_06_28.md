			- yesterday I tried different methods to make Sherlock's table columns more adaptive to new metrics, I think instead of specifying in the code which metrics to display, I can check the data before rendering it to decide which column to hide, because if the values of a metric are absent, it means the metric is redundant to that violation type, so UI doesn't need to show that column to the user, this way, I can maintain a list of all possible metrics, and let the code decide which metrics to display, and I'm still testing this method to see if it will accidentally hide a necessary column
			- today I plan to look at how to let adult monitoring and search policy violation to use the same fact table in the database
