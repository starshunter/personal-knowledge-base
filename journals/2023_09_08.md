	- ## Morning
		- 05:41 #[[Wake Time]]
		- [[David Weinman]] asked what would be the impact if we change the ad type source [[WSO/20456]]
			- did some research
			- top failed source tag would pass the check
			- but many passed source tag would fail as well
		- [[Uni/Standup]]
		- [[Incident/5532256/Post Mortem]]
			- had some new action items
			- [[Uni]] put the scoreboards in `/dev/shm` to improve performance
	- ## Afternoon
		- started to implement [[Uni/6022]]
			- add new request parameters to enable the extensions
			- add new parameters to [[Bing]] request
			- use the bucket D1136
				- successfully trigger the extensions
			- the extensions came in the form of callout extension
			- asked [[Justine Mock]] some questions
		- [[Tomek Majchzak]] had some questions about [[Uni/Omega]] release
			- [[ScrewDriver]] builds the [[Docker/Image]] in `k8s-ci-publish` step
			- seems like [[Uni/Omega]] would build the [[Docker/Image]] and [[Artifact]] twice
				- once in canary, another time in `production-sg3`
