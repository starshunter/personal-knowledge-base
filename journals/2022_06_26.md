		- gather notes for [[PI/Sprint Planning]]
			- so in the last sprint, I studied how to use PVC on Omega, so Sherlock can store its input data and responses from different services into PVC, and since PVC's life cycle is independent of the pod, this allows the adult image detecting script to resume its progress in case of pod restart, and no need to create additional database table
			- and I also made a new design for Sherlock's frontend table, because in the current version of Sherlock, the table uses many columns to display different metrics, but not every violation type requires showing all metrics, some violation types only need one or two of them, so this results in a sparse representation of data, and if there are more violation types in the future, this table may grow even bigger, so I made a stand alone table for each violation type, which only displays the metrics that violation type needs to make the ui more intuitive, but I also keep the current version of the table, so if the users are already used to doing works on it, they can still use the original table
			- so for Sherlock, I need to submit my request to add new tables to the database in the production and staging environment, so I need to review my schema design first. Originally, I designed the adult monitoring report to use a new table to store its fact data, since its on a separate page from the search policy violation report, but i think it is possible to let them use the same fact table, so I will look into that
