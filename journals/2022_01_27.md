	- rising interest rates or bond yields are bad for equities because the discounted future cash flows will be lower, so does its present value
		- thus a positive relation between bond and equity prices, or a negative relation between bond yields and equity prices
			- an exception is .com bubble, since the valuation was too high, the valuation tank despite bond yields decrease
			- the same situation happened after financial crisis
	- in turns of inflation, because company's cash flow is linked to inflation, so equities offer better protection than bonds
	- however, equites have higher risk in times of deflation
	- the correlation between bonds and equities turns negative under growth shock, recession or black swan events
	- some factors may affect the negative impact on equites when bond prices fall
		- point of the cycle
			- earlier is better
			- usually occur in early stage of cycles, so valuation is fairly low
			- if it occur later in the cycle, investors may worry about inflation
		- speed of adjustment
			- slower is better
			- if it rise too quick, valuation of risky assets may fall due to growth expectation
		- level of yields
			- lower is better
			- if yields are low, equity prices tend to be negatively correlated to bond prices, because low yields mean possible deflation problem, thus a rise in yield means confidence in growth
			- the turning point is around 4% to 5%
		- valuation
			- lower is better
		- the cause of yield rise

	- topics of the story is interesting, personalities of man lead's family are also interesting, but the overall performance is really awkward, even a bit annoying
	- man lead basically care about others more than himself and his family, also very indecisive, that's  why his performance is annoying
	- his neighboring family seems to have domestic violence, but remain unresolved
	- neighbor upstairs seems to have a demential old lady, who failed to recognized her grandson

	- array
		- syntax
			- `[<length>]<type>`
			- `[<length>]<type>{<value_1>, <value_2>, ..., <value_n>}`
			- `[...]<type>{<value_1>, <value_2>, ..., <value_n>}`
			- `[<length>]<type>{<index_1>: <value_1>, <index_2>: <value_2>, ..., <index_n>: <value_n>}`
				- the order of the `<index>` doesn't affect the declared array
			- `<value> = <array>[<index>]`
			- `<array>[<index>]` = <value>
			- ```golang
			  for i:=0; i<len(<array>); i++ {
			  	// access <array>[i]
			  }
			  ```
		- details using array
			- `<length>` is necessary for array declaration in go, or use `...` instead
			- arrays of same data type but different length cannot be compared
			- on contrary, array of same data type and same length can be compared
				- different arrays with same number of elements and same data type are the same
			- order of the elements inside array is immutable
	- slice
		- syntax #Golang/Syntax
			- `var <name> []<type>`
			- `<new slice> = append(<slice>, <new element>)`
			- `<new slice> = append(<slice>, <new element 1>, <new element 2>, <new element 3>, ...)`
				- the amount of new elements can vary
				- or use unpack operator `...` after slice to unpack slice and use it in `append`
			- `<new slice> = <array or slice>[<start>:<end>]`
				- element on `end` is not included
				- can omit both `start` and `end`
				- `<new slice> is a reference to old slice or array`
			- `<new slice> = make(<slice type>, <length>, <capacity>)`
				- `capacity` can be omitted
		- mechanism of slice
			- slice uses a hidden array to store data
				- after appending an element, this hidden array may or may not be replaced by a bigger array
			- there are 3 hidden attributes for slice
				- pointer to the start of hidden array
				- length
				- capacity
			- length is the current number of data slice has, whereas capacity is the maximum number of data slice can have
			- if appending a new element doesn't cause the number of element exceeds capacity, the new element will be placed in original array, but if it exceed, than a bigger array will be allocated, all values in original array will be copied to new array, finally the action of `append` occur
		- details of using slice
			- slices cannot be compared
			- modify one of the slice element may affect other slices that reference to same hidden array
			- `append` a new element to one slice may cause the hidden array to be changed, which than cause further change on this slice can't be seen by other slices
			- two ways to not reference to old slice(array) when creating a new slice
				- `append(<new slice>, <old slice>...)`
				- `copy(<new slice>, <old slice>)`
					- if the length of `<old slice>` is bigger than `<new slice>`, than only the amount of element `<new slice>` can have will be copied
	- map
		- syntax #Golang/Syntax
			- `map[<key type>]<value type>`
				- return `nil`
			- `map[<key type>]<value type>{<key 1>: <value 1>, <key 2>: <value 2>, ..., <key n>: <value n>}`
			- `make(map[<key type>]<value type>, <capacity>)`
				- you cannot use `cap()` to check the capacity of `map`
				- will return an initiated `map`
			- `<name>[<key>] = <value>`
			- `<value>, <exist> := <name>[key]`
			- `delete(<name>, <key>)`
				- delete a non-exist key won't cause any error
		- details using map
			- only comparable types can be used as key
			- map should not be used to store serial data
			- when you assign a map to a new map, than two maps share the same underlying data structure
				- use `for range` to avoid this behavior
			- use `for range` to iterate through a `map` may get different result each time
	- custom types
		- syntax #Golang/Syntax
			- `type <custom name> <core types>`
		- details using custom types
			- you cannot directly compare a custom type with its core type
				- conversion is needed
			- you can add methods to custom types
			- `type <alias> = <core types>` will create an alias for a type, they are basically the same thing
	- struct
		- use to collect a bunch of related data, similar to class
		- syntax #Golang/Syntax
			-
			- ```golang
			  type <name> struct {
			  	<field 1> <type>
			      <field 2> <type>
			      ...
			      <field n> <type>
			  }
			  ```
			- `<name>.<field>`
			- `<variable> := <struct name>{<filed 1>: <value 1>, <field 2>: <value 2>, ..., <field n>: <value n>}`
				- field can be omit as long as the order of each field-value pair is preserved
				- field without initial value will be initiated with zero value of field type
			- ```golang
			  <variable> := struct {
			  	<field 1> <type>
			      <field 2> <type>
			      ...
			      <field n> <type>
			  } {
			  	<value 1>,
			      <value 2>,
			      ...
			      <value n>,
			  }
			  ```
				- this is called anonymous struct
		- details using struct
			- struct cannot be inherited
			- if every field's type is comparable and field names are the same, than that struct is comparable
				- the same can apply to normal struct and anonymous struct, but not different normal struct
	- embedding struct
		- when a struct is embedded to another struct, than the embedded struct's fields are promoted to embedding struct's fields
		- syntax #Golang/Syntax
			- ```golang
			  type <name> struct {
			  	<field> <type>
			      <struct type>
			  }
			  ```
			- `<variable>.<embedded struct type>` to access embedded struct
			- `<variable>.<embedded struct type>.<field>` has same effect as `<variable>.<promoted field>`
		- details using embedding struct
			- the field names of embedded struct cannot be the same as embedding struct
				- if there are fields having the same name, than that field will not be promoted
			- when initiating embedded struct' fields, need to use struct name to initiate #Golang/Syntax
				- ```golang
				  <variable> := <embedding struct> {
				  	<embedded struct>: <embedded struct> {
				      	<field>: <value>
				      }
				  }
				  ```
				- `<embedding struct>.<embedded struct>.<embedded field>`
				-
	- add method to custom type
		- syntax #Golang/Syntax
			- ```golang
			  func (<receiver> <type>) <function name>() {
			  	<code>
			  }
			  ```
				- the value of the `<receiver>` is just a copy
			- ```golang
			  func (<receiver> <*type>) <function name>() {
			  	<code>
			  }
			  ```
				- `<receiver>` point to the variable that called the method
			- `<receiver>` cannot be core types, interface or pointer
			- the above declaration should be in the same package as the custom type
			- if a pointer of struct want to access the struct's field or method, no need to dereference first, the compiler will do it automatically
			- if a custom typed value call a method that required pointer, the compiler will do the conversion itself, the same applies to when a pointer call a method that required value
		- details using method
			- if a pointer of struct want to access the struct's field or method, no need to dereference first, the compiler will do it automatically
			- if a custom typed value call a method that required pointer, the compiler will do the conversion itself, the same applies to when a pointer call a method that required value
	- interface and type check
		- type conversion #Golang/Syntax
			- `<type>(value)`
			- go doesn't have implicit type conversion
			- for untyped value, go has its own rule to infer its type, refer to [this article](https://go101.org/article/value-conversions-assignments-and-comparisons.html)
		- type assertion
		  id:: 61f542da-537c-4991-b080-898add78081a
			- `interface{}` can accept any type of variable, but to know what is the actual type of the parameter, we need to do type assertion
			- type assertion occurs in runtime
			- `<value> := <variable>.(<type>)` #Golang/Syntax
				- if assertion fail, program will panic
			- `<value>, <ok> := <variable>.(<type>)` #Golang/Syntax
				- use `<ok>` to check if the assertion success or not
		- type switch
		  id:: 61f542da-86e4-401e-9c2e-17133686f92a
			- ```golang
			  switch <value> := <variable>.(type) {
			  case <type>:
			  	<code>
			  case <type>, <type>:
			  	<code>
			  default:
			  	<code>
			  }
			  ```
			- you cannot use `fallthrough` in type switch
			- when a `case` is matched and there's only one type in that case, the value will automatically convert to that type
