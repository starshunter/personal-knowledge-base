		- 11:57 #[[Wake Time]]
	- ## Morning
		- 06:50 #[[Bed Time]]
		- [[MingMin Bai]] canceled today's [[Uni/Taiwan Sync]]
		- [[MingMin Bai]] asked me or [[Trinity Wong]] to investigate a [[Core Dump]] happened [[2023-08-21 Monday]] on [[Uni/Omega]]
			- the log didn't get stored into [[PVC]]
			- tried to use [[GDB]] to get more information from the core file
				- missed lots of debug symbols
		- [[Yahoo/Summer Intern/Daily Standup]]
		- [[TW Backend/Standup]]
	- ## Afternoon
		- installed debug info packages #Uni/Omega
			- the [[Core Dump]] trace still missed some symbols
				- especially [[Byfor]]
			- noticed some [[Pull Request]] [[Pod]] had similar [[Core Dump]]
			- tried to sync the log to [[PVC]] directory to see if there's some insights
				- the log needed to be generated directly in [[PVC]], otherwise it won't capture the actual error
		- found out the timestamp on [[Core Dump]] file was during [[Pod]] startup phase #Uni/Omega
			- confirmed with [[Trinity Wong]] that [[Uni/Omega]] would create the [[Core Dump]] file directly in [[PVC]]
				- the path `/var/crash/app` is a [[Symbolic Link]]
			- another [[Uni/Omega]] also had this same problem
			- multiple [[Pull Request]] pods also had this prolem
	- ## Night
		- [[VIVANT/EP6]]
			- nogi developed the second personality when he was in the orphanage
			- nozaki realized nogi's father is a terrorist
			- ooda got bailed to help beban
			- she was asked to hack into tendo's server to see past message
			- ooda locked the data and threatened to kill herself
			- nogi proved himself that he really wanted to help Japan
			- the police tried to catch nogi but failed
			- nogi and other beban member met with their leader
