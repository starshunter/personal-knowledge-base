	- pretty good, the atmosphere is really pressing
	- acting is also pretty good
	- tomoka was kidnaped
	- haruto and michiru worked with the police to rescue tomoka
	- haruto sold his company's share to gather 500 millions
	- the negotiation failed because haruto failed to answer a question about michiru, and the kidnaper suspected they already contacted the police
	- the kidnaper promised to reopen negotiation, if haruto and michiru exclude the police from the case
	- they went on live, explained the case to the public, tried to force the police out of the case
	- the theme song was really good too

	- $inventory \space turnover = \frac{cost \space of \space goods \space sold}{average \space value \space of \space inventory}$
	- inventory turnover measures how fast a company can sell its inventory
		- days of inventory directly tell the investor how many days it take for the company to sell its inventory
	- low inventory turnover means the process of selling products is not efficient
	- high inventory turnover means each department is efficient with their part in the selling process
	- inventory turnover too high is not necessary a good thing, because the company may have nothing to sell if a big order is coming
	- compare inventory turnover of the same company in different period to observe change in selling efficiency
