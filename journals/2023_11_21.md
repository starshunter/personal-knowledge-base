			- [[David Weinman]] pointed out some ads [[Splunk]] logging is missing
		- added the missing [[Splunk]] logging
			- `Installment Plan` is not an extension, but get treated as an extension in implementation for convenience
			- `Thin Text Ad` is not an ad type, it's a special kind of Text Ad with empty description
			- created a [[Pull Request]]
		- [[TW Backend/Standup]]
	- ## Afternoon
		- [[TW Backend/Sprint Planning]]
		- worked on [[Multilayer Bucket]] logic refactoring
			- get familiar with what I've done a few months ago
			- understand [[MingMin Bai]] conclusion
				- confirmed with her again
			- move the whole logic to `BingPreProcModule`
