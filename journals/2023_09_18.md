- # Daily Log
	- ## Midnight
		- 00:14 #[[Bed Time]]
	- ## Morning
		- 05:43 #[[Wake Time]]
		- [[YDisc]] can't send [[HTTPS]] request #Uni/6024
			- using [[ATS]] for redirection means [[SSL]] session is created by ats
			- need to configure [[Istio]] to reroute [[HTTP]] request into [[HTTPS]]
		- studied how [[SAGW]] migrated to using [[Istio]] to connect to [[Sherpa]] #Uni/6024
			- it still uses [[ATS]] as proxy to send the request
			- the request is sent in [[HTTP]], and to port 4080
			- need to configure additional resources to map the request to [[HTTPS]] and port 4443
		- studied how to use [[Kustomize]] to create [[Virtual Service]], [[Destination Rule]] and [[Service Entries]] #Uni/6024
			- need a new [[Yaml]] file for [[Kustomize]]
			- it can use conditions to decide whether to create additional resources
			- the generated resource definition files can be found in [[ScrewDriver]] artifact directory
	- ## Afternoon
		- used [[Kustomize]] to configure [[Istio]] #Uni/6024
			- use [[VMBridge]] as the testing endpoint
			- override the [[ATS]] redirect rule, so the request is sent in [[HTTP]] and to port 4080
			- asked [[Kevin Hsu]] to give the [[ScrewDriver]] pipeline the required permission
			- successfully deployed the resources
			- still couldn't hit [[VMBridge]]
				- no [[CA Certificate]]
				- need ask [[Kevin Hsu]] for permission to delete the resources
