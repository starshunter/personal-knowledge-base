		- [[Uni/Standup]]
			- [[MingMin Bai]] suggested to combine two APIs into one for [[Uni/5817]]
				- all the use cases are the same
		- I forgot to modify the Makefile of `common`, that's why it failed to build repeatedly #Uni
			- the build was successful after modifying the Makefile
	- ## Afternoon
		- implement the refactoring of apollo multilayer logic #Uni
			- can't compile again
			- modules can't find the implementation of `GalileoBucket`
			- need a full rebuild for the change to take effect
