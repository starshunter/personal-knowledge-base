# Daily Log
	- ## Midnight
		- 02:35 #[[Bed Time]]
	- ## Morning
		- 08:13 #[[Wake Time]]
		- gather notes for [[PI/Standup]]
			- for me, yesterday I was working on showing inaccessible domains in the UI, and I will start to work on showing inaccessible images today, and yesterday I also talked to SMP team, they confirmed the error I got when sending an image url request means SMP timed out while downloading the image, and because right now there's no option to adjust this timed out value, so I will proceed with the current method of handling these image urls
		- [[Amar Kamat]] suggested [[HLFS]] may keep a cached copy of inaccessible images #Sherlock
			- he also asked me what is [[Sherlock]]'s timelin
				- no timeline yet
				- probably will release in [[2022/Q3]]
			- DONE keep [[Amar Kamat]] updated about [[Insight API]] usage status
		- added custom filter component for number of unique source tag field #Sherlock
			- blocked and not blocked
			- reference to [[MUI]] document
	- ## Afternoon
		- wrote code to store inaccessible images into database with nsfw score of -1 #Sherlock
		- if [[Insight API]] cannot access certain image, use [[HLFS]] instead #Sherlock
			- using HLFS can get the content directly
			- encode the content into base64 and send it to Insight
			- TODO  will test this tomorrow
			  SCHEDULED: <2022-07-28 Thu>
		- wrote UI to show inaccessible image #Sherlock
			- need to show partial blocked in number of unique source tag field in rollup view
			- in violation view, show adult image count and inaccessible image count in the same field
			- modified API and UI to show inaccessible image url in image modal
				- set `text-wrap` style to `break-word`
	- ## Night
		- fixed components overlaid material table header problem #Sherlock
			- adjusted header z index
		- [[初戀的惡魔/EP2]]

			- a murder happened in an apartment
			- the victim was killed by a scissor
			- mabuchi found out his fiancé was having an affair
			- she wanted to maintain an open relationship
