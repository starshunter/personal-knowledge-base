		- 08:45 #[[Wake Time]]
		- [[Laura Calverley]] said her request wasn't working #Uni
			- need to remove `TextAds` from `mainlineAdTypesFilter` as sell
			- the data source of her request are ad and image
			- there's no ad in the response
				- but there're ads in the response when `TextAds` is in `adTypesFilter`
			- asked for API doc
		- [[PI/Standup]]
	- ## Afternoon
		- studied [[PI/Middleware]] to see how the [[SQL]] queries are made #Statslite/Migration
			- the controller will execute an action
			- the action will use a service
			- the service will use a [[Java/Spring Framework/DAO]]
			- a stored procedure then execute
			- [[PI/Database]] stored all the procedures
			- there's no procedure in [[Edlite]] that is called by [[PI/Middleware]]
