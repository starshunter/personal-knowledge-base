		- [[MingMin Bai]] added me to a [[Slack]] discussion about [[Uni/5932]]
		- [[Uni/Taiwan Sync]]
			- talked about recent [[Core Dump]] on [[Uni/Omega]]
				- should investigate why [[Byfor]] would abort
			- for [[Uni/5966]], merge the [[Pull Request]] next week
			- I can turn off the `TeeMode` on [[QA]] host
		- restart [[Pull Request]] [[Pod]] to investigate the problem #Uni/Omega
			- no special error message in [[Byfor]] log
			- found [[Byfor]] error in [[YDisc]] log
				- [[Byfor]] can't open the local [[Database]]
		- [[TW Backend/Standup]]
		- [[Ares Huang]] taught me how to submit an expense report
			- need to submit the receipt
	- ## Afternoon
		- tried to understand the previous discussion on [[Uni/5932]]
			- could deprecate the client ID rotation logic
			- could always assume the client ID from [[SFE]] is correct
			- only generate new client ID when there's nothing from [[SFE]] and `skipClientIdRegen=0`
				- may or may not deprecate using [[BCookie]] to generate
		- [[Tomek Majchzak]] pointed out [[YDisc]] may have started too early so it can't open [[Byfor]] local [[Database]]
			- need to be sure when does [[Uni/Omega]] restart the services
		- [[Yahoo/Summer Intern]] farewell dinner
