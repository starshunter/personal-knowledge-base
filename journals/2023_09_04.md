- # Daily Log
	- ## Midnight
		- 00:06 #[[Bed Time]]
	- ## Morning
		- 07:33 #[[Wake Time]]
		- studied [[Istio]] on [[Pluralsight]]
			- it's a kind of service on [[Kubernetes]]
				- applications can register to [[Istio]], and they can communicate with each other
				- also called services mesh
				- offer traffic management, security and observability
				- it adds a [[Proxy]] to the applications register to it
					- it's transparent to the applications
			- can deploy [[Virtual Service]] to configure [[Istio]] for traffic [[Routing]]
				- define routing rules to direct the traffic
				- use [[Destination Rule]] to configure what' the traffic's destination after routing
			- [[Istio]] can secure the communications between services in the services mesh without managing the certificates and rules
				- [[Istio]] would manage the certificate for [[MTLS]]
					- set global [[Policy Resource]] and [[Destination Rule]]
				- use `PERMISSIVE` to allow services without [[Istio]] to still communicate to your service
				- add [[Authorization Policy]] to apply authorization with [[Istio]] managed certificates
					- can specify which principal can access the service and do what action
					- can also require how external users are authenticated
	- ## Afternoon
		- figured out how [[ATS]] is sending requests for [[Uni]] currently
			- only send requests to [[Uni/Geo]] and [[VMBridge]]
			- needed to come up with a plan to use [[Istio]] to replace it
		- [[Tomek Majchzak]] introduced [[Trinity Wong]] and me to some [[Uni]] modules
