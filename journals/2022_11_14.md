# Daily Log
	- ## Midnight
		- 02:16 #[[Bed Time]]
	- ## Morning
		- 08:26 #[[Wake Time]]
		- [[Andrew Matau]] fixed my [[QA]] host #Uni
			- need to delete two files and restart `awe_data`
		- couldn't trigger credit card ads from my [[QA]] host #Uni/5714
			- made sure it was the same request I made two weeks ago
			- waited over five minutes between each call
			- can't be my implementation problem, because there's no credit card ad in the response
			- asked [[Justine Mock]] about this
		- [[PI/Sprint Planning]]
	- ## Afternoon
		- [[Fox Wu]] approved by [[Pull Request]] #Sherlock
		- the deployment failed #Sherlock
			- the `appName` is associated with [[Athenz]] service being used, so I can't change it
			- added `subdomain` to the job deploying to bf1
				- `subdomain` will be included in the default domain, so it should be able to avoid conflict
	- ## Night
		- [[Atomä¹‹ç«¥/EP5]]
			- atom's game couldn't get permission to sell online
			- okitsu offered to let atom's to publish their game on sagas' platform, in exchange he wanted atom's technique
			- they couldn't find a way to advertise their game
			- they decided to sell the game with models
			- their game exceeded one million downloads
			- sagas' game won all the game awards
			- atom world won another game award which was voted by the gamers
			- atom didn't fulfill one of the conditions agreed with the bank
			- the bank became atom's shareholder, and it sold the share to sagas
