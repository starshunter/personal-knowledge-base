		- 11:59 #[[Bed Time]]
	- ## Morning
		- 05:34 #[[Wake Time]]
		- tested more about when will [[AutoScaler]] kick in #Uni/Omega
			- confirmed that the average [[CPU]] usage of the [[Pod]] needs to cross 50%
			- there seemed to be a delay
		- [[Yahoo/Summer Intern/Daily Standup]]
	- ## Afternoon
		- updated [[Uni/5972]] [[Uni/5973]] [[Uni/5974]] [[Pull Request]]
			- deleted related metrics, debug information and graphs
			- if the class of `QuickLinks` in web response needs to be removed, propose to remove the web response entirely
		- confirmed the [[AutoScaler]] won't be triggered if only one [[Pod]] has [[CPU]] usage greater than 50% #Uni/Omega
		- if the average [[CPU]] usage is much greater than 50%, then the new [[Pod]] would be created immediately #Uni/Omega
	- ## Night
		- [[警部補大魔神/EP6]]
