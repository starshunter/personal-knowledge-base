# Daily Log
	- ## Midnight
		- 23:48 #[[Bed Time]]
	- ## Morning
		- 05:44 #[[Wake Time]]
		- [[Uni/5714]] has been released
		- [[Shruthi Shyamala]] didn't respond to my message
		- found `SMILE_REPORT`'s password on [[GitHub Enterprise]] #Statslite/Migration
			- found the [[DDL]] of the remaining views
			- all views are created
		- tried to create table using [[Java/Sprint Framework/iBatis]]
			- failed, can't find table
		- [[PI/Standup]]
	- ## Afternoon
		- tried to use [[SQL/Stored Procedure]] to execute [[Statslite]] query #Statslite/Migration
			- need to create in [[Edlite]]
			- need to create a package first to use [[SQL/Cursor]] type
			- need a out variable to read the result from the cursor
		- can execute [[Statslite]] query successfully #Statslite/Migration
			- currently [[Statslite]] created tables when running the query, and delete them at the end
			- if we use [[SQL/Cursor]] to read the result, we can't delete the tables
			- need to find the other way to run the query, if we still decide to use cursor to return the result
