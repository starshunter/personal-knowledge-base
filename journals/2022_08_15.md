		- gather notes for [[PI/Standup]]
			- for Sherlock, I was updating the YDS schema, but there's a field I created before for adult monitoring report that is actually redundant, because I can use another existing field to achieve the same purpose, so I'm changing my code for this, and also I plan to create a PR for Sherlock in the next few day, so I'm doing some small adjustment and adding some comment to my code
		- [[PI/Standup]]
		- changed the code to use `referer_domain` #Sherlock
	- ## Afternoon
		- encountered some problems after changing to `referrer_domain` #Sherlock
			- UI won't update after bulk edit success
				- need to use key to force update
			- cannot directly edit status cell
				- `material-table` now returns old value using lookup object, so instead of number, now it returns a string
				- removed recording status update history for temporary fix
		- cleaned up some code #Sherlock
			- made removing columns more concise
		- merge with newest master #Sherlock
			- had problem running `npm install`
			- company's npm registry didn't have `@next/env`
				- updated `.npmrc` to use company registry only when installing company's package
				- not sure if this will be a problem when deploying
	- ## Night
		- rewrote some comments and cleanup some code #Sherlock
