		- got assigned to [[Uni/5932]]
		- tried to recreate [[Core Dump]] on [[Uni/Omega]] [[Pod]] by running the commands inside `app_start.sh`
			- successfully caused [[Core Dump]]
			- still need to study why it happened
		- [[Yahoo/Summer Intern/Daily Standup]]
		- studied [[Uni/5923]]
			- [[Uni]] is not sending correct `X-MSEdge-ClientID` for [[AOL]]
				- should send a random value when `optOut=1` and `skipClientIdRegen=1`
			- tried to understand how [[Uni]] generate `ClientID`
	- ## Afternoon
		- [[Yahoo/Summer Intern/Final Presentation]]
		- thought about how to solve [[Uni/5932]]
			- draw a flow chat about how `BingPreProcModule` generate the value
			- had some questions regarding `skipClientIdRegen` and how to generate the expected value
			- created a draft [[Pull Request]] to test the initial method
		- [[Tomek Majchzak]] asked me to take a look at the [[Pull Request]] in [[Uni/AWE]] for [[Uni/5928]]
