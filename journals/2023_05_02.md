		- [[Uni/Taiwan Sync]]
			- need to verify setting `svc_status->cname` doesn't effect the [[Bing]] host being called by [[VMBridge]] #Uni/5844
			- [[MingMin Bai]] will update the details about how to fix [[Uni/5857]] later
		- went through document about private search on [[Uni]] #Uni/5844
			- [[VMBridge]] does consume header `X-VM-DEST-PATH`
				- not cleared about the usage in the document, but it was stated in another page that it uses it to forward the request
			- [[YDisc]] uses the `endpoint` sent in the `invoke()` to call the endpoint
				- for private search, the endpoint is localhost
			- [[Uni]] sent [[VMBridge]] host in the `Host` header of the request which is sent to localhost
			- the request is sent to localhost by setting the endpoint to `UniVMB_1`
			- proposed another solution in the [[Pull Request]] that doesn't require to modify `svc_status->cname`
		- [[PI/Standup]]
	- ## Afternoon
		- tested changes made for [[Uni/5857]]
			- [[MingMin Bai]] told me how to get a valid `hdata` from [[Splunk]]
