# Daily Log
	- ## Midnight
		- 00:03 #[[Bed Time]]
	- ## Morning
		- 05:43 #[[Wake Time]]
		- [[Tomek Majchzak]] added some comments to my questions about #Uni/5814
			- it should be fine to extract `rguid` from `ImpressionFeedbackUrl`
			- [[MingMin Bai]] asked me to work with [[Bharath Mudegowdar]] and [[Shruthi Shyamala]]
		- [[Vincent Chuang]] found the issue about the empty response body #YPI/1660 #PBob
			- he changed the API method to `GET` on his devbox
		- still couldn't get the data for the new dimensions #YPI/1660 #PBob
			- need to use `20230302` as `endDate`
		- [[PI/Standup]]
		- [[Jack Chiang]] said he should change something in [[PI/Database]] to let [[PBob]] use newer date #YPI/1660
		- had a talk with [[Ares Huang]] about the incident of [[Uni/5714]]
			- not to take on unnecessary responsibility in the future
			- let [[SFE]] and PM communicate the bucket details
	- ## Afternoon
		- [[Jack Chiang]] set up a new date for [[PBob]] #YPI/1660
			- can see the data for all dimensions
			- the order of one API call was weird
				- it should returns the partners with top 5 revenue
				- [[Vincent Chuang]] found out it was a bug in the [[SQL]] statement that didn't consider `null` value
				- the fix was deployed on his devbox
		- found the behavior was weird in by performance page #YPI/1660 #PBob
			- the requests in by performance view will add a new parameter, but the parameter name provided by [[PBob]] didn't match with the name in [[PI/Middleware]]
			- [[Vincent Chuang]] fixed the name in his devbox
				- still find abnormal behavior for the two new dimensions
		- asked a question in the [[Jira]] ticket of [[Uni/5814]]
		- looked into [[Uni/5814]]
			- for web search, the `rguid` is parse and stored in `BingResponseHeader`
			- there's a method in `BingAdResponse` that could extract `rguid` from `ImpressionFeedbackUrl`
				- I should be able to use it in the `MultiMediaOutputModule` to print the `rguid`
