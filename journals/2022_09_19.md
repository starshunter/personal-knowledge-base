		- prepare for [[PI/Sprint Planning]]
			- for Sherlock, I deployed Sherlock to prod zone, which is the preferred way to connect to YDS, so I think we can stop pushing Sherlock to corp zone when adult monitoring is about to release to production
			- and for the requests from MIT, I added a small uploading history here in the uploading page, so the users can have a better understanding about the input file they have submitted, and also what is the status of this input, so Sherlock cannot tell the user exactly how long will it take to process a file, but it can tell users which step this input is currently processing, like crawling the first level or second level, or it is classifying the images and so on, and once the input is finished, an email will be sent to the user to let them know the data has been generated, and I use the internal mailing service Sonic to send the email, so it can send email using google group, and I can use ecp to configure this google group to decide who will receive this email
			- and one more thing about Sherlock is the crawling error caused by crawling a domain too frequent, so I ran the crawling scripts again from two different colo last week, and this is the status code I got, and this period is when Sherlock schedule the script to run in bf1, and from the status code, there are still some domains that didn't unblock bf1 HLFS even after two weeks of waiting, and compare the status code to this period, which I ran the script manually from gq1, there are almost no this kind of blocking error base on the status code, so I'm not sure how long will those domains keep blocking bf1 HLFS, but if the blocking persist, I think Sherlock needs to run the script in gq1 in order to get the better result, and also ensure the crawling method won't trigger any domain to block HLFS again
			- for Sherlock, I need to ensure the current crawling method won't trigger any domain to block HLFS again, so I will run the script and record the time interval of each request send to HLFS, to make sure it won't crawl the same domains too frequent
		- [[PI/Sprint Planning]]
			- [[Clement Lee]] said I should ask [[MIT Team]] about the mail notification #Sherlock
	- ## Afternoon
		- gathered the scoring of each image, sent the email to [[MIT Team]] #Sherlock
		- studied [[Uni]] modules
		- [[Trinity Wong]] said she created a document for her study
			- we will sync up again at tomorrow
