# Daily Log

		- 00:03 #[[Bed Time]]
	- ## Morning
		- 05:38 #[[Wake Time]]
		- [[Mingmin Bai]] assigned [[Uni/5832]] to me
			- remove legacy code in `StreamlineModule` about woeid
		- some problems with my [[Uni]] [[QA]] host
			- can't send a request
			- [[Apache Traffic Server]] was crashing
				- couldn't extract config
			- tried installing a lower version
			- tried `yinst restart -all`
			- tried stopping traffic server
			- needed to change the permission on a shared object file
				- then restarted traffic server
			- [[QA]] host was recovered
		- [[PI/Standup]]
		- [[Trinity Wong]] suggested me to use an [[OWS]] host to build [[Uni]] package
	- ## Afternoon
		- worked on [[Uni/5832]]
			- no need for additional logic for [[AOL]] traffic
				- [[AOL]] request can be found on `search.aol.com`
			- sent a obfuscated IP to [[Talon]] for private search
				- this IP is sent with a header `UserIP`
				- private search request can be found on `onesearch.com`
			- used `curl` commend to test with [[QA]] host
			- created a [[Pull Request]]
		- generated a tag for [[2023-04-13 Thursday]] [[Uni/Release]]
		- studied [[Byfor]] #Uni
			- [[Uni]] runs [[Byfor]] during startup
				- log in `/home/y/logs/uni_server_byfor_run`
				- read config from `/home/y/conf/uni_server/byfor.conf`
			- some servers in the config file didn't get expanded correctly
			- some servers have the same host name
			- only part of the hosts returned error
				- can't find the domain name or empty record
				- use `dig` on those domains verified they don't have [[DNS]] record
			- still need to know whether [[Byfor]] store the answer of the servers in local [[Database]]
