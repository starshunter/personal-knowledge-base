		- 00:04 #[[Bed Time]]
	- ## Morning
		- 05:48 #[[Wake Time]]
		- [[Trinity Wong]] and [[Mingmin Bai]] approved [[Uni/5714]]
			- [[Trinity Wong]] merged it
		- fixed failed [[Unit Test]] in `StreamlineModule` #Uni/5817
			- needed to set the mock `DataHandleService` before running the tests
				- originally, some tests can pass without `DataHandleService` being available
			- needed to make sure the time `getDataHandle` is called, and the types the `DataHandle` is returned are correct
			- all the tests passed
		- [[PI/Standup]]
	- ## Afternoon
		- asked [[Fox Wu]] about how to find the information about the fields [[MIT Team]] wanted to use in the new violation type #Sherlock
			- he suggested me to check `pmc_source_by_search_daily` and get more information
			- he also suggested me to talk with [[Ares Huang]] about resource allocation before implementing this violation
		- changed the usage of `TldBoundary` library to the new data handle in `GenericDataLookupModule` and `UniAnnotatorModule` #Uni/5817
			- these modules doesn't have [[Unit Test]]
				- how to test these modules?
			- [[Uni/SBL]] will use this new data handle in `UniAnnotatorModule`
