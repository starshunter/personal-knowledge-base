	- ## Morning
		- 09:06 #[[Wake Time]]
		- [[Fox Wu]] told me about a new request about [[PBob]]
			- need to set up the dev environment first
		- setting up [[PBob]] dev environment
			- followed the wiki
			- lots of package need to install separately
			- remembered to add `edge_rpms` repo
	- ## Afternoon
		- [[ATS]]9 can't be restarted correctly
			- lack a file in `/usr/local/bin`
			- asked [[Leon Ku]] about this
				- he provided that file, and I copied it to the destination
			- `post-deploy` finished correctly
		- tried to access dev [[PBob]] through browser
			- it's only a blank page
			- not sure how [[YApache]] serve it
