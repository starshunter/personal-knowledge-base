		- [[Uni/Standup]]
			- still having issue with [[Uni/Release]]
			- [[Mingmin Bai]] said I may need to remove some hosts from `byfor.conf` #Byfor
		- checks which hosts are unreachable by [[Byfor]] #Uni
			- some hosts have no record at all, while some other have CNAME record, but no A record
	- ## Afternoon
		- checked where does [[Uni]] use the hosts listed in `byfor.conf` #Byfor
			- some of the modules that use the services are disabled
			- some services or modules are deleted
			- checked with [[Mingmin Bai]] to see if it's save to remove those hosts from the config file
