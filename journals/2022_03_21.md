		  title:: The Memory Hierarchy
	- memory technologies
	  collapsed:: true
		- different technologies have vastly different tradeoffs
		- size is a fundamental limit
		- ((623878ee-52e2-455b-a36e-09500539e42d))
	- memory hierarchy
	  collapsed:: true
		- exposed
			- attach a variety of storage alternatives of varying sizes to the CPU
			- need to change ISA or allocate regions of address space for each type of memory
				- not practical to scale
		- implicit
			- single memory, single address space
			- data is stored in fast or slow memory depending on usage pattern
			- CPU sees large, fast memory if values are found in cache most of the time
	- cache
	  collapsed:: true
		- temporal locality
			- if a location has been accessed recently, it is likely to be accessed in the near future
		- spatial locality
			- if a location has been accessed recently, it is likely that nearby locations will e accessed in the near future
		- a small, interim storage component that retains data from recently accessed locations
		- processor sends accesses to cache
			- cache hit
			- cache miss
			- processor must deal with variable access time of memory
		- cache design is all about reducing AMAT
		- direct mapped caches
			- each word in memory maps into a single cache line
			- use index bits and tag bits for query
			- store multiple words in one line to exploit spatial locality
				- result in larger miss penalty
		- write policy
		  collapsed:: true
			- write-through
				- CPU writes are cached, and also written to main memory
			- write-back
				- CPU writes are cached, but not written main memory until the line is replaced
				- memory content can be stale
				- need a dirty bit to track if the line has been modified
			- no cache write on a write-miss
				- write is sent directly to the memory on cache miss
