		- [[Simon Turnbridge]] merged the [[Pull Request]] about enhancing description conversion #[[YK Data Pipeline/Consolidation]]
		- [[Trinity Wong]] asked to pause on [[Uni/6483]]
		- [[Simon Turnbridge]] also not sure why the disambiguation texts didn't get removed #[[YK Data Pipeline/Consolidation]]
			- confirmed the enricher is working using the [[NQuad]] from the output
	- ## Afternoon
		- asked [[Simon Lee]] about attribute extraction of `Company`'s subtypes #[[YK Data Pipeline/Consolidation]]
			- he said [[Simon Turnbridge]] asked to only implement the extraction in parent class
		- investigated unreconciled entities #[[YK Data Pipeline/Consolidation]]
			- for Spain, there's a country type triple
				- it's not compatible with person tyep
			- it has a producer type because a movie marks it as the producer
		- notified [[Kelly Ke]] about staging and production result comparison
