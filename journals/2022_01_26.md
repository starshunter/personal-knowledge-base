	- cycles in the past
		- 1970s
			- rising inflation pushed interest rates and bond yields, draw valuation down
			- cycle that start with structural problems tends to have longer growing phase
				- this cycle had one of the longest
		- 1980s
			- driven by falling inflation expectations and interest rates, result in P/E expansion
		- 1990s
			- low inflation and interest rates, he fall of Soviet Union and the opening of China drove the cycle
		- 2000 - 2007
			- best earnings growth but low returns
			- driven by financial sector
		- 2008 - now
			- longest so far
			- the phases are distorted
				- sovereign debt crisis in Europe
				- emerging market and commodity price falls
			- unconventional policy easing (QE), low inflation and bond yield
			- weak profit growth but rising valuations
			- US outperforms others, tech generate more profits than others
	- major cycles consist of shorter-lived cycles
		- typically occurred in grow phase
		- just a slow down within expansion
		- investors follow monthly or quarterly data, thus form the min cycles
		- watch ISM for example, negative with positive inflection is the best period to buy
		- generally, ISM increasing and accelerating is best time to buy
		-
	- equities return and bond yields are dependent in mini cycle
		- in recovery phase, returns are higher when bond yields fall

  collapsed:: true
	- different assets react to growth and inflation differently
		- in later period of recession, defensive assets have the best performance
		- in early recovery phase, equities rebound sharply
		- in later phases of expansions, equities with higher beta perform best
		- in early recession, defensive assets start to outperform, oil still do well, equities underperform most
		- high and rising inflation is not good to both equities and bonds
			- policy tighten up and growth not able to compensate inflation
		- rising inflation from low level is a sign of the end of recession
		- commodities can be a diversifier in late cycle period
	- different assets' performance in different phases of investment cycle
		- |   |equities |bonds |commodities|
		  |:--- | :---: | :---: | ---: |
		  |despair|-44|1|62|
		  |hope|69|11|2|
		  |growth|2|-2|5|
		  |optimism|48|9|28|
		- bond and equities are forward looking, thus typically don't do will in growth phase
		- but commodities are driven by supply and demand, and actual growth reflects stronger demand

  collapsed:: true
	- story progression is a bit slow, but the turn of main character's mind was elaborated very well
	- two main characters both have miserable past
	- female lead cried for the first time since she lost her mom
	- man lead reflected on his manner, try to apologize to female lead
	- female lead has a high probability to be deaf two months later, so she decided to try something never did before
	- they start dating, without actually being attracted to each other
	- female lead start to have some symptom, probably will hide it from man lead

	  difficulty:: Medium 
	  duration:: 15 mins
	- first time solving it
	- the problem is quite straightforward
	- wanted to solve it in one loop, but couldn't find a way to do in-order traversal simultaneously
	- use two loop and two extra array instead
	- performance is pretty bad, definitely need to improve my solution

  collapsed:: true
	- go is a strongly typed language
	- boolean values
		- `true` or `false`
	- numbers
		- integers or floating-point numbers
		- every number's zero value is `0`
		- integer
			- singed number
				- `int8`, `int16`, `int32`, `int64`, `int`
			- unsigned number
				- `uint8(rune)`, `uint16`, `uint32(byte)`, `uint64`, `uint`
			- `int` and `int64` may be the same on one machine, but they cannot be used interchangeably, same as `uint` and `uint64`
			- every integer type cannot be used interchangeably
			- use `int` for general purpose, change it base on different situation
		- floating-point numbers
			- `float32` or `float64`
			- numbers will be broken down to integer part and floating-point part
		- overflow and wraparound
			- overflow occurs when you assign an initial value that exceeds variable's limit
			- wraparound occurs when you change the value of a variable outside its limit, than it will start over from its maximum or minimum value
		- big numbers
			- reside in `math/big` [package](https://pkg.go.dev/math/big)
		- byte
			- alias of `uint8`
			-
	- `string`
		- go supports two types of string literal, raw or interpreted
		- raw string literal will print exactly what you write on screen
		- interpreted string literal will transform some special characters first
		- you'd need to add extra `\` to display `\` and `"` correctly in interpreted string literal
	- `rune`
		- a type that can store one UTF-8 character
		- string literals in go are encoded in UTF-8 format
		- string is actually a read-only byte slice, so a UTF-8 character may be broken down to several byte
		- if a string contains multi-byte character, it is best to convert it to `rune` slice than print it
		  ```golang
		  runes := []rune(string)
		  ```
		- if you wish to iterate through a slice of rune or a string literal containing multi-byte character, it's best to do it by using `range`
		- use `len` on string may result in weird output, so convert it to `rune` slice if necessary
	- `nil`
		- literal representation of zero values of many kinds of types
		- `nil` for different type are not the same type
		- [useful article](https://go101.org/article/nil.html) containing some facts abut `nil`
- # Night
- learn some queries in logseq #Logseq/Advance
	- indention have to make sense
		- child has to be directly related to its parent
		- siblings are blocks that cover information about their parents
	- how to use queries?
		- `{{query [[page]]}}` will give you every pages that are linked to input page
		- `{{query (and [[A]] [[B]])}}` will give you every pages that are linked to `A` and `B`
		- `{{query (or [[A]] [[B]])}}` will give you every pages that are linked to `A` or `B`
		- `{{query (and [[A]] [[B]] (not [[C]]))}}` will give you every pages that are linked to `A` and `B` but not `C`
		- `{{query (property property_name property_value)}}` will give you all the pages with that property and value
		- `{{query (TODO status)}}` will give you all the task with input status
