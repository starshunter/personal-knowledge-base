		- decided to write adult monitoring's exclusion list feature inside the existing exclusion page #Sherlock
		- gather notes for [[PI/Standup]]
			- yesterday I continue to rewrite apis used by adult monitoring table, so both search violation table and adult monitoring table can use the same set of apis
			- I also implemented exclusion feature in adult monitoring table to let user filter out violations, right now I can add new exclusion rules, but when I went back to search violation table, the exclusion feature is  broken there, so I think I have to redesign the table schema of exclusion list for adult monitoring table, and today I will focus on fixing this issue
			- also, since both search violation table and adult monitoring table are using the same apis, I will study if it is possible to rewrite the pages into components to make the code more reusable
	- ## Afternoon
		- implement exclusion feature for adult monitoring table #Sherlock
	- ## Night
		- DONE draft for tomorrow's demo
		  SCHEDULED: <2022-06-09 Thu 08:30>
			- I put the adult monitoring table on a separate page from the original search policy violation table, and you can access the table by clicking the link above here, then you will see a similar table showing the general information about the violations we have found regarding adult images in partners' referrer domain
			- a row in this table represents that we have found adult images in the referrer domain of this partner, it tells you when we started to find adult images, and how many unique source tags are tied to this domain
			- and the remaining columns are very similar to the original search policy violation table, like status of this violation and the owner of this violation, and these columns are the metrics provided in the input data, I just group them by partner and referrer domain then sum them up
			- so to see the detail of a violation, we can expand it, which will take us to another table, each row in this table shows one of partner's source tags tied with this referrer domain, you can also see the more detailed metrics of this source tag
			- and if you click the drop down sign here, you can inspect the violation detail of the same source tag at different times, currently, these metrics are all the same because I used the same sample data to simulate what it looks like by clicking the drop down sign, but in production environment, these metrics are retrieved from the uploaded data, so they should be different
			- the button here can show the adult images we found in this domain this month, it will display the URLs of adult images we have found, you can click it if you want to see the actual image, right now, these URLs are faked and stored in the local database because I haven't gained access to use HLFS, but in the production environment, we should be able to get these image URLs by crawling the page
			- so this is the violation table, and just like the search policy violation table, you can select multiple rows and edit them, like assigning the owner of these violations, or edit the fields directly in the table
			- and this adult monitoring table can also use the exclusion feature, so suppose I want to filter out this violation, I can go to the exclusion page, choose the partner, and violation type, enter the referrer domain and add the exclusion rule, then we successfully filter out that violation
			- so this is what the adult monitoring table looks like right now, is there any question about this user interface
			- the user should be able to select multiple violations and file a jira ticket for them, and there is a template for search policy violation, should adult monitoring use the same template?
			- according to the notes from our discussion last time, it says the ui should allow the user to compare images in different month, does the current implementation satisfy this requirement
