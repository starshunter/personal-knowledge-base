		- 07:12 #[[Wake Time]]
		- [[Linh Tran]] sent me a [[Bing API]] document #Uni
			- `enableDisclaimerInfo` can take both `AutoAds` and `TextAds`
			- not sure whether `TextAds` should be added to every request
		- [[Sherlock]] bi-weekly meeting
			- [[Jasmine Basci]] asked to add bulk edit status feature to image list view
			- need to fix highest scoring bug in rollup view
		- gather notes for [[PI/Standup]]
			- for Uni request, I got an Bing API document from PM this morning, and I think it can help me understand the request and response between uni and bing api, and for Sherlock, there's not much update from this morning's meeting, but there are some small feature requests, so I will also work on this today
