	- ## Morning
		- 07:20 #[[Wake Time]]
		- [[David Weinman]] preferred not to contact [[MSFT]] to ask about [[Uni/6590]]
			- they may take this feature out
		- updated [[TWHKSRP/3258]] [[Pull Request]]
		- [[Simon Lee]] asked if it's necessary to implement `countryLocation`
			- [[Kelly Ke]] confirmed we can skip it
			- she also asked about some entities with simplified Chinese title
				- probably a known issue caused by [[MediaWiki]] [[API]]
				- [[CAKE Team]] will fix them on their end
	- ## Afternoon
		- worked on [[Uni/6590]]
			- asked [[YongMing Liu]] to verify the output format
		- worked on implementing Chinese label fallback mechanism #[[YK Data Pipeline/Consolidation]]
			- finished initial implementation
