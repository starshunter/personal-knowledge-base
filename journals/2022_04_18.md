	- a terrorist bomb attack happened
	- shimura was investigating another crime while the explosion happened
	- the criminal behind the explosion wanted shimura to met with him
	- turned out it was a woman that called shimura out
	- she baited him with information that he wanted
	- she led him to the information about the information
	- the woman got caught
	- shimura found out the explosion was about a NGO director and a reporter
	- he suspected the reporter wanted to revenge the director
	- but it was actually the director wanted to frame the reporter to cover his corruption
	- shimura saved the reporter in time, and the bomber was also caught
	- the woman proposed that the police cooperate with her

	- using generics has some benefits
	  collapsed:: true
		- stronger type checks at compile time
		- elimination of casts
		- implement generic algorithms
	- type parameter naming conventions
	  collapsed:: true
		- E, element
		- K, key
		- N, number
		- T, type
		- V, value
		- S, U, V
	- we can substitute a type parameter with a parameterized type
	- a raw type is a type where the class is generic, but the type argument is omitted during the declaration
	  collapsed:: true
		- assigning a parameterized type to a raw type is ok, but will get a warning in reverse
	- generic methods are methods that introduce their own type parameters
	  collapsed:: true
		- list of type parameters need to go before return type
		- list of type arguments need to go before method name
	- bounded type parameters can help us to restrict the types that can be used as type arguments
	  collapsed:: true
		- use `extends` keywords, follow by upper bound
		- it also allows us to invoke methods defined in the upper bound
		- there can be multiple bounds
			- classes must be specified before interfaces
	- `Box<Integer>` is not a subtype of `Box<Number>`
	  collapsed:: true
		- their common parent is `Object`
		- we can subtype a generic class or interface by extending or implementing it
			- `ArrayList<Integer>` is a subtype of `List<Integer>`
	- type inference allows us to invoke generic methods without specifying type parameter
	  collapsed:: true
		- the compiler can infer the type from the input
	- type inference also allows us to instantiate a generic class without specifying its type parameter
	  collapsed:: true
		- we must leave the `<>` in the declaration
	- we can use `?` and `extends` to set the upper bound of a variable
	  collapsed:: true
		- unlike generic method, where we use bounded type parameter for the entire method, we can restrict the type of individual variable using upper bound wildcard
	- unbounded wildcard allows us to give variable an unknown type, so we can stuff any type into that variable
	  collapsed:: true
		- unlike using `Object`, using unbounded wildcard allows us to use type specific methods
	- we can use `?` and `super` to set the lower bound of a variable, so only instance of the class and its super class can be passed into the variable
	- `B` is a subtype of `A` doesn't mean `List<B>` is a subtype of `List<A>`
	  collapsed:: true
		- instead, both `List<A>` and `List<B>` are subtypes of `List<?>`
		- `List<? extends B>` is a subtype of `List<? extends A>`
		- and `List<B>` is a subtype of `List<? extends B>`
	- type erasure implements the generic feature
	  collapsed:: true
		- it replaces all the type parameters in generic types with their bound or `Object`
		- it inserts type cast if necessary
		- it generates bridge methods if necessary
		- type information is intentionally dropped during compile time for backward compatibility
	- some restrictions on using generics
		- we cannot instantiate generic types with primitive types
		- we cannot create instance of a type parameter directly, but we can do it using reflection
		- we cannot declare static fields with types of type parameters
			- static fields are class-level variable
			- after type erasure, classes with different type parameters are considered to be the same class
		- we cannot use casts or `instanceof` with parameterized types
			- because of type erasure, we have no idea which parameterized type is being used at runtime
			- the compiler does allow some casts, if it know the casts will always be valid
		- we cannot create arrays of parameterized types
		- we cannot create, catch or throw objects of parameterized types
		- a class cannot have overloaded methods that will have the same signature after type erasure
