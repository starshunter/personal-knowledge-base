		- [[Nick Moeller]] cannot access staging [[PI]]
			- he need to request access to [[Okta/UAT]]
		- studied how to resolve [[MYSQL]] `ER_CLIENT_INTERACTION_TIMEOUT` error #Sherlock
			- tried to reproduce it first
		- [[PI/Standup]]
	- ## Afternoon
		- cannot reproduce [[MYSQL]] `ER_CLIENT_INTERACTION_TIMEOUT` error #Sherlock
			- [[JavaScript]] package blocked sending query to closed connection
				- it may have forget to implement the block somewhere
			- got the error when the command line session expired
			- after the code releasing a connection, it turned into sleep status, and after the `wait_timeout` expired, [[MYSQL]] server killed the connection
				- can create a connection and kill it every time, but the performance would be bad
			- maybe we can destroy all the connections in the pool if we get the error
				- guarantee the next connection will be new and valid
				- no build in method, need to reset the pool
