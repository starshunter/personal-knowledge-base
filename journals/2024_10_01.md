		- [[Simon Turnbridge]] didn't want to apply same enricher twice #[[YK Data Pipeline/Consolidation]]
			- he suggested to only apply the enricher to entities having Chinese labels
			- he suggested another way that doesn't need to apply the enricher twice
				- extract specialized label from [[Wikidata]], and remove the disambiguation text from labels in `wikipedia-texts`
				- blending will make sure the specialized labels will get added, but the value is coming from `wiki-zh`
		- [[Trinity Wong]] said I can proceed with [[Uni/6483]] #Gutenberg/Migration
			- listed the options I have
			- explore uploading options, found out the permission on [[Omega]] [[Pod]] is very restrictive
		- updated [[Pull Request]] about extracting unique Country relations #[[YK Data Pipeline/Consolidation]]
	- ## Afternoon
		- [[TW Backend/General Update]]
		- [[Kelly Ke]] informed they had switch to using specialized labels #[[YK Data Pipeline/Consolidation]]
			- also, the limited metrics data looked good
			- created a [[Pull Request]] to enable Chinese entities daily update
		- worked on removing outdated [[Query Profile]] attributes #Gutenberg/Migration #Uni/6571
			- removed attributes related to [[Uni/CatIdToTermModule]]
			- removed attributes related to [[Uni/TermLabelModule]]
