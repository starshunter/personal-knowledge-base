	- ichimoto met with girl who said she was sexually insulted by an employee of comphor news' parent company
	- comphor news was shut down by niwa
	- seiko told everyone to go home, but she started to investigated the case
	- camphor news tried to found a taxi with lucky cat
	- they found the taxi, and also got testimony of the case
	- seiko was attacked by fake news, and they found out it was niwa that leaked the information
	- niwa ignored the case, because he wanted to protect himself
	- seiko said she would still publish the news despite niwa begged her not to
	- camphor news published the news as a whole
	- three months later, everyone changed their position
	- seiko was still seeking the truth

	- problem:: Broken Calculator
	  link:: https://leetcode.com/problems/broken-calculator/
	  difficulty:: Medium
	  duration:: 20 mins
	- first time solving this problem
	- if starting value is bigger than target value, we can only decrease the starting value to reach target value
	- we can increment and divide the target value to that it reach starting value
	- we can prove this method is valid

		  title:: Operating Systems
	- modern computers cannot function without some resident programs, which are shared by all users
	  collapsed:: true
		- I/O devices have very long access latency as compared to registers and memories
		- switch to another program while waiting for an I/O operation to complete
	- goals of operating systems
	  collapsed:: true
		- protection and privacy
			- processes cannot access each other's memory
		- abstraction
			- OS hides details of hardware
		- resource management
			- OS controls how processes share hardware
	- private address space per process
	  collapsed:: true
		- each process is allocated space in physical memory by the OS
		- a process is not allowed to access the memory of other processes or the OS
	- scheduling
	  collapsed:: true
		- the OS schedules processes into the CPU
		- a process cannot use more CPU time than allowed
	- system calls
	  collapsed:: true
		- the OS lets processes invoke system services via system calls
		- ABI defines how process and kernel pass arguments and results
	- process life cycle
	  collapsed:: true
		- OS maintains a list of all processes and their status
		- if a process invokes a system call that cannot be satisfied immediately, it is blocked and put in the waiting state
	- ISA extensions to support OS
	  collapsed:: true
		- two modes of execution
			- user
			- supervisor
				- privileged instructions and registers
		- interrupts and exceptions to safely transition from user to supervisor mode
		- virtual memory to provide private address spaces and abstract the storage resources of the machine
	- exceptions
	  collapsed:: true
		- event that needs to be processed by the OS
		- exceptions usually refer to synchronous events, generated by the process itself
		- interrupts usually refer to asynchronous events, generated by I/O devices
		- handling exceptions
			- the processor stops the current process, completing all the previous instructions
			- saves the PC and the reason for the exception in registers
			- enables supervisor mode, disables interrupts and transfers control to a pre-specified exception handler PC
		- if the exception is due to an illegal operation by the program that cannot be fixed, the OS aborts the process
