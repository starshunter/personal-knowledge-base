		- [[Fox Wu]] suggested me another way to fix incorrect exclusion list join #Sherlock
		- gather notes for [[PI/Standup]]
			- for Sherlock, last week I was studying how to let the user specify multiple referrer domain in the exclusion list, then I found in current version of Sherlock, the exclusion list cannot properly exclude violation under certain condition, and because I was using the same logic to add the new feature, it also failed under the same condition, so I will fix this issue first, then go back to work on the new feature
		- [[PI/Standup]]
		- submitted the [[Pull Request]] to fix incorrect exclusion join issue #Sherlock
		  id:: 62c4f4c3-2be1-44e4-bd78-26d89f885fdf
			- `package-lock.json` doesn't need to be included
	- ## Afternoon
		- rewrote the exclusion join in my current working branch #Sherlock
			- the code looks much cleaner now
		- write some comments, clean up some code #Sherlock
	- ## Night
		- took a brief look at the dependency issue #Sherlock
			- `next`, `material-table` need to update according to github plugin
			- `mui` also need to update according to `material-table`
