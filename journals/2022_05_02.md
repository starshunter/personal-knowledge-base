				- if the information is non-actionable, but might be useful in the future, then use tags and `type:: Reference` for future reference
				- information that are not urgent or important, use `someday` page
				- for articles to read, videos to watch, use `to/...` to classify them
				- add `trash` hashtag for useless information
