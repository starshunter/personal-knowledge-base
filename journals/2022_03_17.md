	- problem:: Score of Parentheses
	  link:: https://leetcode.com/problems/score-of-parentheses/
	  difficulty:: Medium
	  duration:: 2 hrs
	- first time solving this problem
	- failed to solved it by myself, tried stack and recursion
	- use stack to record every window's score

  collapsed:: true
	- niina and nishino went to the hotel which naria had been to
	- nishino fainted out in the hot spring
	- niina met with the hotel's manager, who was seino's father's assistant
	- seino went back to his old home to find the locker for the key
	- niina talked to the manager again, but was drugged
	- niina used some trick to drugged the manager, and got the truth he wanted
	- seino found his father's design draft
	- the manager was threatened by nariai
	- seino gave nariai the fake design draft, because his memory was restored
	- the boss of seino's father was the villain behind all the schemes

		- if two latches are driven by the same C signal, they pass and hold signals at the same time
		- if latches are driven by inverted C signal, one is always holding and one is always passing
		- D Flip-flop only change its output when C change from 0 to 1
		- add write enable signal to D Flip-flop to avoid signal and output change at the same time
