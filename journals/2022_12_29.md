# Daily Log
	- ## Midnight
		- 02:20 #[[Bed Time]]
	- ## Morning
		- 08:54 #[[Wake Time]]
		- [[Trinity Wong]] asked about the permission denied we got when making the sample call #PI/Middleware #Statslite/Migration
			- [[Chih-Yu Ko]] suggested us to comment out the code that caused the problem
			- [[Fox Wu]] said we could directly replace the `classes` folder in our dev box, but need to rerun some `cp` command
		- [[PI/Standup]]
		- tried to use my own build of [[PI/Middleware]] in the dev box #Statslite/Migration
			- use `mvn` to build
			- the built files are in `target` folder
			- moved `classes` to `/home/y/libexec/webapps/PartnerAnalytics/WEB-INF`
				- needed to change the owner, group and permission
			- ran `cp` commands
			- ran `yinst restart yjava_jetty`
			- cannot show new log
	- ## Afternoon
		- reran the bootstrap script #PI/Middleware #Statslite/Migration
			- the log worked again
		- created directory `/mnt/upr/errorFiles` #PI/Middleware #Statslite/Migration
			- opened write access
			- resolved permissioned denied error
		- still cannot make successful sample call #PI/Middleware #Statslite/Migration
			- the code will check ip address
			- commented out the code and pretended the check pass
			- the sample call succeed
		- tried to figure out how [[PI/Middleware]] access [[Edlite]] #Statslite/Migration
