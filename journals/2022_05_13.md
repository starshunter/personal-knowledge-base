	- ## Morning
		- 08:27 #[[Wake Time]]
		- study [[HLFS]] at high level
			- the way HLFS will be used is to fetch image urls from a given url
			- we can specify the tag we want to craw
				- for our case, it's `<img>`
				- maybe some special cases, like the website set the image as background
		- gather notes for [[PI/Standup]]
			- study [[HLFS]] and [[SMP]], and their relation with the new report of [[Sherlock]]
			- study [[HLFS]] onboarding, there are some questions need to be clarified before submit
			- find if there is a testing service of [[HLFS]]
		- [[PI/Standup]]
			- DONE [[Clement Lee]] said I should discuss [[HLFS]] onboarding questions with [[MIT Team]]
			  id:: 627dca02-71ea-42aa-a68d-7b82aef5e10e
			  DEADLINE: <2022-05-13 Fri 18:00>
		- write a draft of the email to send to [[Eric Arenas]], about [[HLFS]] onboarding questions ((627dca02-71ea-42aa-a68d-7b82aef5e10e))
	- ## Afternoon
		- DONE need to update my working machine
		  DEADLINE: <2022-05-13 Fri 20:00>
		- study [[SMP]] at high level
			- UGC stands for user generated content
			- two API
				- moderation and enrichment
				- [[Sherlock]] should use moderation API
			- moderation API has two usage modes
				- sync
				- async
			- onboarding
				- need to ask [[Eric Arenas]] about the desired SLA
				- average and peak submission per day can only be assessed after knowing how many images are there per domain
				- need some sample data to know average and max content size
				- DONE some moderation options need to be discussed #Sherlock #SMP
			- usage
				- need to submit requests using XML
				- some options in XML I think are unnecessary, but they didn't get marked optional
				- SMP's response is not definite, it gives us how confident it is
				- there are multiple sub-classifier in image classifier
				- there's a Java client, but it van only be used to construct XML requests
