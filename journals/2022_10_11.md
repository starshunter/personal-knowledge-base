# Daily Log

	- ## Morning
		- 08:12 #[[Wake Time]]
		- [[Justine Mock]] confirmed the position of credit card ad #Uni/5714
			- may need to create a new ad region
		- gather notes for [[Uni/Sprint Planning]]
			- for credit card ad, I followed the requirement document and api document to write the code to build bing request and parse the response, but MSFT hasn't enable credit card ad in the bucket, so I haven't test my implementation yet, also, I have discuss the output design with frontend engineer, and we would like to wait for MSFT confirmation on the number of image in one credit card ad first, before deciding the format
			- I have a question about the position of the credit card ad, so justine confirmed the position should be verticaladsidebar
		- [[Uni/Sprint Planning]]
		- gather notes for [[PI/Standup]]
			- for Sherlock, I finished implementing the feature request from MIT about using two image detection models together, so today I will start to test if other features work correctly, and for uni, I just got confirmation on the ad region of credit card ad from PM, so I will start to create this ad region and make sure the data is logged correctly
		- [[PI/Standup]]
		- failed to use nsfw_v4 model in [[Insight API]] #Sherlock
			- 500 internal server error
	- ## Afternoon
		- [[Michael Reyes]] asked about whether multiple types of ad can coexist in the sidebar
			- confirmed with [[Justine Mock]]
		- studied code related to ad region
		- asked [[Amar Kamat]] about [[Insight API]] issue #Sherlock
		- asked [[Junye Lu]] about whether I should create a new ad region #Uni/5714
