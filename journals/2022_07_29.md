		- fixed inconsistent adult image count problem #Sherlock
			- next js api need to return a response
		- gather notes for [[PI/Standup]]
			- for me, yesterday I was working on showing inaccessible images in Sherlock, and also allow the user to update their judgement of an image, but so far, I noticed under some conditions, there's a significant delay between two different api calls after the user make an update, and if the user continue to do more actions in the UI, this delay may cause inconsistency between the data in the frontend and data in the database, so I plan to reproduce this bug first, then find out what is the cause of the delay

		- tried to implement image viewer #Sherlock
			- not sure if it helps, stay with current implementation for now
