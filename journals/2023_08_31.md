	- ## Morning
		- 05:51 #[[Wake Time]]
		- [[Vinayakumar Kolli]] answered most of my questions about [[Uni/5932]]
			- need to confirm what's the case for MR traffic
		- [[Uni/Taiwan Sync]]
			- got assigned to work on [[ATS]] [[Certificate]] refresh
				- needed to studied [[Omega]] network and [[Istio]]
			- needed to ask who can I contact to discuss about [[Uni/5932]]
		- [[Sean Liu]] asked for explanation on [[Uni/5966]] and the related [[Splunk]] field
		- started [[Uni/Release]]
		- [[TW Backend/Standup]]
	- ## Afternoon
		- noticed [[Pod]] in [[Uni/Omega]] started to crash #Uni/Release
			- tried to cleanup the [[Core Dump]] files, but the [[Pod]] still continued to crash
			- old pods in gq1 were gone, it's escalated to [[Incident]]
				- noticed the image [[SRP]] had no result
			- found an error log in pod initialization log
				- `dh_config.properties` was missing during pod initialization
				- tried to verify if it was the root cause
				- not much progress
			- [[Tomek Majchzak]] and [[Kevin Hsu]] found it may relate to the erroneous [[Yamas]] templated release several days ago
				- verified that a variable for [[Yamas]] scoreboard path wasn't substituted
			- [[Kevin Hsu]] started the rollback
			- the rollback finished
