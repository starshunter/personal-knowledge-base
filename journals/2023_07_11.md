# Daily Log
	- ## Midnight
		- 00:27 #[[Bed Time]]
	- ## Morning
		- 06:56 #[[Wake Time]]
		- [[Shruthi Shyamala]] confirmed current logic is acceptable #Uni/5928
			- confirmed again what she meant to send filters in other regions
		- [[Uni/Taiwan Sync]]
			- [[MingMin Bai]] suggested other methods to build [[Bing]] request #Uni/5884
				- new endpoint, new parameters
				- needed to check with [[Shruthi Shyamala]] about whether to apply `LegalDeleteModule`, and if insights token need to be encrypted
		- fixed the incorrect output format #Uni/5884
			- added debug info
			- the related searches response doesn't have `pingSuffix`, but has `K` and `appNs`
			- can't use the config file for MMS, since the response structures are different
		- [[TW Backend/Standup]]
	- ## Afternoon
		- [[Tomek Majchzak]] had some suggestions about [[Uni/5884]]
			- don't reuse old data source
			- don't add new parameters for data source
			- use `responseFilter` to specify modules to use
				- disregard
		- updated [[Unit Test]] for [[Uni/5928]]
			- considered ad count
