			- for Sherlock, I got the access to use HLFS, so I started to use it and SMP to produce adult monitoring report, and after running the script with the input data, it did successfully identify six different domains with adult images, and store this result into database, but there are still some problems need to address, so let me share my screen to show the problems I have found, for example there are over four hundred unique domains in this input data, but HLFS can only access 85% of these domains, for the rest 15%, some of them are simply removed, but most of them are not accessible because they restrict the crawler from accessing their pages, so I need to find a way to let the user know they need to do manual review for these domains, and for SMP, the script found 3400 images from the input data, but SMP cannot download and classify 10% of the images, I'm still confirming with SMP team, but I think its because the owners of these images restrict the access request from non-browser entity, so for these images, I also need to find a way to let the user know they required manual review, and another thing is about the input data, so MIT hope the report can tell them how many adult images are there under a domain, or at least find the adult images in the domain page, and pages that are one level down from the domain page, but there's no built in option in HLFS that could achieve this, it can only crawl the page that is pointed by the url provided in the request, so I discussed this with MIT last week and described what kind of input data I need to get their desired result, so instead of only providing one domain url in the input data, I need more specific urls to ask HLFS to crawl in those pages, so they will discuss about this, and I will go through the document again to see what I can do
			- for Sherlock, last week MIT described to me how they wanted to handle domains that block HLFS from access their content, so basically they wanted to show these domains in the UI, but instead of telling the user the number of adult images, the UI will show these domains are not accessible and required manual review, and for images that are not accessible by SMP, I plan to do similar thing to notify the them to do manual review, and I think I will start with how to separate these special domains and images from the normal in the database
