	- ## Morning
		- 05:41 #[[Wake Time]]
		- [[Uni/Sprint Planning]]
			- [[David Weinman]] had a ticket [[Uni/6542]] that is similar to [[Uni/6620]]
				- confirmed some details with him
				- need to enable this extension for [[Syndi]]
		- [[Simon Turnbridge]] had some comments on my [[Pull Request]] #[[YK Data Pipeline/Consolidation]]
			- [[Pull Request]] was approved
		- [[Simon Lee]] asked about whether to implement `enroll` #[[YK Data Pipeline/Consolidation]]
			- confirmed with [[CAKE Team]] that we don't
	- ## Afternoon
		- [[TW Backend/General Update]]
		- updated [[Uni/6620]] [[Pull Request]]
		- tried to read `ykc` output on the [[Yahoo Grid]] #[[YK Data Pipeline/Consolidation]]
			- the output of each entity is multiple graphs, using [[GraphQL]] is more ideal
		- asked [[Simon Turnbridge]] about how to apply the new enricher
