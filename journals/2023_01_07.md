# Daily Log
	- ## Midnight
		- 01:22 #[[Bed Time]]
	- ## Morning
		- 08:39 #[[Wake Time]]
		- [[Justine Mock]] asked about [[Uni/5714]] progress
		- [[Ares Huang]] asked about the dependency of [[UNI/5700]] and [[Uni/5714]]
			- he suggested me to remove `TextAds` from `enableDisclaimerInfo`
		- [[Jack Chiang]] introduced [[Gutenberg]] to me and [[Trinity Wong]]
			- talked about the system architecture
			- talked about three different use cases and two pipelines
			- need to clarify how [[Uni]] read the [[XML]] configuration files
				- may need to produce the output from [[COSMOS]] directly to [[Uni]]
	- ## Afternoon
		- made the changes [[Ares Huang]] suggested
		- studied why [[PI/Middleware]] devbox couldn't connect to [[Edlite]] #Statslite/Migration
			- the same error appear if the ssh tunnel doesn't exist
			- tried to connect to [[Edlite]] locally
				- the same error appears even the tunnel has been set
