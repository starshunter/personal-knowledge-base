		- [[Uni/Taiwan Sync]]
		- had a sync-up with [[MingMin Bai]] and [[Runxi Ding]] about [[Uni/Omega]]
			- reviewed yesterday [[Performance Test]]
			- the main container didn't have much problem under high [[QPS]]
			- other sidecars had high [[CPU]] usage
			- still don't know why the auto scaler didn't kick in when there's a [[Uni/Incident]]
			- needed to try different ways to increase container's [[CPU]] load and test when would the auto scaler work
		- [[Yahoo/Summer Intern/Daily Standup]]
		- [[TW Backend/Standup]]
	- ## Afternoon
		- filed a [[Pull Request]] to created a container to test increasing [[CPU]] load
			- a infinity loop with timeout could do the trick
		- deployed a [[Replica Set]] that has maximum of two [[Pod]]
			- make sure the requested resources didn't exceed the quota
			- the second pod was created when the main container has [[CPU]] usage over 60%
