# Daily Log
	- ## Midnight
		- 01:35 #[[Bed Time]]
	- ## Morning
		- 08:45 #[[Wake Time]]
		- [[Jasmine Basci]] reported a bug about not able to file [[Jira]] ticket #Sherlock
		- [[PI/Standup]]
			- [[Clement Lee]] said I could release [[YPI/1646]] before the holiday
		- [[Fox Wu]] approved my [[Pull Request]] #PBob
			- he told me to push staging first, and ask others to check
		- staging [[PBob]] had a problem
			- [[Fox Wu]] asked [[Jack Chiang]] and [[Chih-Yu Ko]] about it
	- ## Afternoon
		- [[Jack Chiang]] was looking at the [[PBob]] issue
			- it was fixed
		- couldn't figure out cause the problem reported by [[Jasmine Basci]] #Sherlock
			- the error was caused by [[MYSQL]] server terminating the connection, because the time of inactivity exceeded 60 seconds
				- not sure why, because the connection was release every time after executing the query, and the query is executed right after the connection is fetched
			- the [[Jira]] api call should be successful, but there's no issue in the project
			- tried to reproduce, but the [[Jira]] ticket was created
			- asked [[Fox Wu]] about this
				- he also could create a [[Jira]] ticket
				- he suggested me to ask [[MIT Team]] to try again
		- [[YPI/1646]] had a problem in dev environment #PBob
			- the break down component cannot be initialized
			- need to remove the code locally, and clone the repository again
			- rebuild the changed modules and succeed
