# Daily Log
	- ## Midnight
		- 00:16 #[[Bed Time]]
	- ## Morning
		- 05:37 #[[Wake Time]]
		- pushed [[Sherlock]] new feature to production
			- allow users to upload multiple input files a month
		- looked at [[Sherlock]] tiny images issue
			- proposed to drop image smaller than 2 KB since they are too small
		- checked the servers listed in `byfor.conf` and their usage #Uni
			- only few of them actually are still being used
	- ## Afternoon
		- checked if [[Byfor]] is actually being used in [[Uni]]
			- can't find log about it
			- there's a few lines in `/home/y/logs/uni_server_ydisc_service/current`
			- no logging when resolving IP address
			- [[Uni]] uses `gethostbyname`, but [[Byfor]] only implement `getaddrinfo`
