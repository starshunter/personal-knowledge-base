# Daily Log
	- ## Midnight
		- 02:13 #[[Bed Time]]
	- ## Morning
		- 08:21 #[[Wake Time]]
		- gather notes for [[PI/Standup]]
			- for me, I was fixing some bugs I found in Sherlock yesterday, and they are mostly about the inconsistent data between different pages, and are related to the feature I recently added, because once the user update the status of an image, there may be multiple violations that are affected, and this is a case I didn't consider before, so I'm rewriting some functions and APIs to fix it, and I will continue to work on this today
			- {{embed ((62e88b35-fbeb-46bf-87ce-8b0052b1a209))}}
		- [[PI/Standup]]
		- implemented [[Dynamic Route]] for each violation type #Sherlock
	- ## Afternoon
		- fixed some problems while implementing [[Dynamic Route]] #Sherlock
			- pages didn't refresh problem
				- need to update props inside `componentDidUpdate()`
			- columns disappearing problem
				- moved column filtering code into`componentDidUpdate()`
			- filters not reset problem
				- moved the function into `componentDidUpdate()`
			- adult monitoring violation data missing problem
				- need to pass extra arguments
			- embedded violation table filters not reset problem
				- the embedded table would be unmounted, so clear the filters inside `componentDidMount()`
	- ## Night
		- studied automated testing for #Sherlock
			- chose [[Cypress]]
			- blocked by [[Okta]]
			- tried to implement Okta login function but failed
				- [[Yahoo]]'s express Okta login procedure is different from the method in the document
