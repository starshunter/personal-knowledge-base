		- [[Sherlock/Meeting]]
			- [[Jasmine Basci]] forgot to discuss new input data
			- demoed the feature handling inaccessible domains and images
				- don't include nsfw image links inside the jira ticket
				- [[Jasmine Basci]] will give me the template
			- discussed about the nsfw image threshold
				- shared the document of nsfw images
		- gather notes for [[PI/Standup]]
			- for Sherlock, yesterday I was debugging the two level crawling script, and then used it to process the input data, and this morning it finished executing and the result is a big improvement compares to one level crawling, it found 20 times more images from the input domains and also it discovered 16 new violations, but at the same time I noticed some violation data failed to write into the database, so today I will focus on solving this problem
