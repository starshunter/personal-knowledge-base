		- [[Uni/Standup]]
			- [[MingMin Bai]] asked me and [[Trinity Wong]] to study [[Gutenberg]] migrate to [[COSMOS]]
			- she also wanted us to get familiar with [[Uni/Deployment]]
		- [[Fox Wu]] approved my [[Pull Request]] about [[YPI/1646]]
		- asked [[Fox Wu]] about how to connect to [[Edlite]] from dev host #PI/Middleware #Statslite/Migration
			- he confirmed there should be a tunnel at the jump host
			- asked [[Chih-Yu Ko]] about which host [[Edlite]] is on
			- couldn't connect to port 9022 on the jump host
		- [[PI/Standup]]
	- ## Afternoon
		- [[Chih-Yu Ko]] suspected the jump host only opened some of the port #PI/Middleware #Edlite #Statslite/Migration
			- can connect from my devbox when using port 4080
			- [[PI/Middleware]] still couldn't connect
			- the error messages of [[PI/Database]] and [[Edlite]] are different
