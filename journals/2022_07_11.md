		- [[PI/Sprint Planning]]
			- [[Jack Chiang]] told me about how TQ score is calculated
	- ## Afternoon
		- tried to setup [[PI/Dashboard]]'s development environment
			- packages listed in `README` are incorrect
				- some packages are not available in `rhel7`
			- follow the procedure in `setupjiemonitor.sh`
			- use `yinst list` to find which repo has the package
			- `ykeykeyd-cert-mgnt` is not available in `rhel7`
				- reference to `ykeykeyd` setting in [[Sherlock]] to configure it
			- need to copy `yapache` configuration file to target folder, then restart `yapache` accordingly
	- ## Night
		- try to connect to DB but failed #[[PI/Dashboard]]
			- `login1.corp.yahoo.com` has been removed
			- DONE need to ask [[Fox Wu]] about this
