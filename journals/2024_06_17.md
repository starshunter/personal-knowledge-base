		- [[Simon Turnbridge]] also not sure why some text is missing in HTML #TWHKSRP/3258
			- he pointed out the variations of the text are in the attribute of `span`, but doesn't render properly
		- updated [[Uni/6536]] [[Pull Request]]
			- [[Tomek Majchzak]] approved it
		- implemented term converter #TWHKSRP/3258
			- used `noteTA` to get all the variations available to a page
			- successfully convert the terms for TW and HK
	- ## Afternoon
		- merged [[Uni/6536]] [[Pull Request]]
			- [[Functional Test]] failed
			- test for [[Uni/LegalDeletes]] was causing the host to crash
			- discussed with [[Trinity Wong]]
			- found out the output of [[Uni/LegalDeletes]] log was weird
			- agreed to wait till tomorrow to discuss it
		- still need to address missing text #TWHKSRP/3258
			- need to add another step to pull the text from the attribute
			- need special treatment to avoid getting convert again later
	- ## Night
		- [[Believe/EP8]]
			- riku asked the CEO to tell the truth
			- his wife cooperate with the police to setup a trap
			- he told her what he found
			- the police arrested him
