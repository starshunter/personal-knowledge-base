		- [[Uni/Taiwan Sync]]
		- started [[Uni/Release]]
			- finished without any problem
		- [[Justine Mock]] confirmed we don't need to know the extension type #Uni/6022
			- [[SFE]] should render the extension in the order that are returned from [[Bing]]
			- [[Tomek Majchzak]] still had some concerned about the output format
				- suggested to include [[Nicky Soh]] into the discussion
				- asked [[YongMing Liu]] to hold off the development
		- [[TW Backend/Standup]]
	- ## Afternoon
		- ran [[Performance Test]] to configure [[Istio]] resources #Uni/6024
			- under 250 [[QPS]], need more than 2 [[CPU]]
			- need to check average [[QPS]] on [[Uni/Omega]]
