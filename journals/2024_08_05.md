- # Daily Log

	- ## Morning
		- 05:36 #[[Wake Time]]
		- [[Simon Turnbridge]] had some comments on my [[Pull Request]] #TWHKSRP/3258
			- updated [[Pull Request]]
		- created [[Pull Request]] for [[Uni/6611]]
			- [[Pull Request]] in [[Uni/AWE]] already merged
	- ## Afternoon
		- tried to figure out how to let `ykc` staging to consume new [[Data Pack]] without affecting production #[[YK Data Pipeline/Consolidation]]
			- uploaded new [[Data Pack]] to another directory, and updated the config to read from there
		- tried to confirm with [[Kelly Ke]] if TW/HK [[KG]] is on [[GraphQL]] #[[YK Data Pipeline/Consolidation]]
			- it is
			- [[Simon Turnbridge]]'s suggested fallback method should work
