		- [[Amar Kamat]] said [[Insight API]] was maintaining nsfwv4 model, and it has been back online #Sherlock
			- confirmed
			- he also asked for the nsfw images
		- [[Justine Mock]] confirmed only one `AdImage` will be in `images` field #Uni/5714

			- [[Michael Reyes]] proposed to follow auto ad's format
		- [[Justine Mock]] confirmed the ads in the sidebar are mutually exclusive #Uni/5714
		- gather notes for [[PI/Standup]]
			- for Sherlock, there's a problem on SMP side during the weekend, which cause Sherlock unable to use version 4 model and so produce wrong output, so I will rerun the job today to generate the correct output to test other features, and for uni enabling credit card ad, I will keep working on adding new ad region in uni today
		- [[PI/Standup]]
