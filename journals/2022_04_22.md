	- lack of a mentor
		- you can learn knowledge from books by yourself
		- but only people with experience can tell you what should you learn
		- actively seek technical mentor or manager to guide you
	- never ask question
		- meeting expectations doesn't mean you will succeed in the next level
			- you need to prove you can handle next level works to get promoted
		- maintain a sense of curiosity
		- curiosity leads to ownership and accountability
	- don't invest yourself
		- WLB is important, but completely abandon software engineering in your free time is not ideal
		- connect software engineering with your hobby
		- or at least read some technical articles in your free time
	- don't collaborate enough
		- people afraid to collaborate with others because of insecurity
		- working by yourself will make your perspective stale
		- try pair programming to improve code quality, and to learn from others
	- cannot step outside your comfort zone
		- stop outside to explore new ideas and to test your limit
		- true learning happens outside of your comfort zone
