	- problem:: Boats to Save People
	  link:: https://leetcode.com/problems/boats-to-save-people/
	  difficulty:: Medium
	  duration:: 1 hr
	- first time solving this problem
	- thought greedy method is impossible
	- cannot think of DP method
	- for every person, use binary search to find another person that has the closet total weight to the limit
	- terrible runtime
	- should have use two pointers greedy method
	  collapsed:: true
		- the idea is pretty much like [this](((6233f291-4c26-4268-84db-29164f62b144)))

	- virtual memory systems
	  collapsed:: true
		- protection and privacy
			- each process has a private address space
		- demand paging
			- ability to run programs larger than main memory
			- hide differences in machine configuration
	- names for memory locations
	  collapsed:: true
		- virtual address
			- multiple processes can use the same virtual address that refer to different physical locations
		- physical address
			- OS specifies mapping of virtual address into name for a physical memory location
	- paged memory systems
	  collapsed:: true
		- divide physical memory into fixed-size blocks called pages
		- interpret each address as a pair (virtual page number, offset)
		- use a page table to translate from virtual to physical page numbers
		  collapsed:: true
			- ((623c6918-f27d-47ab-93f1-95b5bbd175a5))
		- each process has a page table
		- OS controls page table register points to the page table of the current process
	- translation lookaside buffer
	  collapsed:: true
		- cache virtual page number to physical page number translations in TLB
		- typically 32-128 entries, 4 to 8-way set-associative
		- once a miss happens, hardware looks up the page table and loads the corresponding mapping into TLB
		- TBL is flushed on a process switch
	- demand paging
	  collapsed:: true
		- all the pages of the processes may not fit in main memory
		- page table entry contains
			- a resident bit to indicate if the page exists in memory
			- physical page number for a memory-resident page
			- disk page number for a page on the disk
			- protection and usage bits
		- demand paging allows bringing only what is needed from disk
	- page faults
	  collapsed:: true
		- an access to a page that is not in main memory causes a page fault
		- page fault handler is invoked
			- choose a page to replace, write it back if dirty bit is set, mark page as no longer resident
			- read page from disk into available physical page
			- update page table to show new page is resident
			- return control to program
