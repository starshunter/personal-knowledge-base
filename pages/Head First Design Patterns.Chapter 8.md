- the template method pattern defines the skeleton of an algorithm in a method, deferring some steps to subclasses, template method lets subclasses redefine certain steps of an algorithm without changing the algorithm's structure

	- abstract class can offer hooks with default implementation, and subclasses can hook into algorithm at various points
	- use abstract methods when subclass must provide an implementation of the method, and use hooks when when that part of the algorithm is optional
- don't call us, we'll call you
	- prevent from creating dependency cycle
	- allows low level components to hook into a system, and high level components determine when they are needed
