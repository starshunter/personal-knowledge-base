- to read from or write to a socket, the procedure is similar to reading from and writing to a file
	- get the stream from the socket, then make a buffer
- a thread is a separate call stack
	- in Java threads, execution can move back and forth between stacks so rapidly that we feel as though all stacks are executing at the same time
	- three steps to launch a new thread
		- make a runnable object
		- make a thread object and give it a runnable
		- start the thread
	- a thread cannot be restarted
- a runnable is the job a thread is supposed to run
	- a runnable must implement the `Runnable` interface, which has one `run()` method
- states of a threads
	- runnable/running loop
	- temporarily not-runnable
- the scheduler decides which which tread can run for how long
	- we can't base our program's correctness on the scheduler working in a particular way
	- put a thread to sleep to ensure every thread gets its chance to execute
- the `synchronized` keyword protect our data, synchronize the methods that act on that data
	- every Java object ahs a lock, and a lock has only one key
	- if an object has synchronized methods, a thread can enter one of the synchronized methods only if the key for the object's lock is available
	- synchronized method has overhead and performance issue, also it may lead to deadlock
