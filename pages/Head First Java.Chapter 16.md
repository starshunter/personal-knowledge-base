- we can use `Collection.sort()` to sort collections with primitive elements
- with generics, we can create type-safe collections where more problems are caught at compile time instead of runtime
- a generic class means that the class declaration includes a type parameter, a generic method means that the method declaration uses a type parameter in its signature
	- we can even use a type parameter that was not defined in the class declaration
- in generics, `extends` means `extend` or `implements`
- to allow the collection of our custom type to be sorted by `Collection.sort()`, our custom type must implement `Comparable` interface
	- or we can pass our custom `Comparator` to the method
- ((625973e4-3bc7-4f04-a751-2e9b00bad005))
- to let a `Set` to treat two objects as duplicates, we must override the `hashCode()` and `equals()` methods inherited from class `Object`, so that we can make two different objects be viewed as equal
	- two different objects can have same `hashcode`
- `TreeSet` elements must be comparable
	- or construct `TreeSet` by passing a comparator into its constructor
- array types are checked again at runtime, but collection type checks happen only when we compile
- using wildcard can create a method that can take collection with element of a class or its subclasses
	- but wildcard will stop us from doing anything that could hurt the collection referenced by the method parameter
