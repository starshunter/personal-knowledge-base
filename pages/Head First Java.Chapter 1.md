- code structure
	- a source file holds one class definition
	- a class has one or more methods
	- a method contains instructions about how that method should work
- JVM looks for the main method in the given class
	- every java application should have at least one class, and at least one main method
- compiler translates the code to bytecode, then JVM takes that bytecode and run it
