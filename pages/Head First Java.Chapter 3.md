- Java variables come in primitive and object reference
	- primitives hold fundamental values
	- object references hold references to objects
- ((62499186-d92d-4634-81f2-b4af0dc9c6e3))
- assign a value to a new variable by
	- typing a literal value after the equals sign
	- assigning the value of one variable to another
	- using an expression combining the two
- objects live in garbage collectible heap, and we can only access them using variables that store object references
- arrays are always objects, even if the array holds primitive type elements
