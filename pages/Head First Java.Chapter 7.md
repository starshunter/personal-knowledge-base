- when one class inherits from another, the subclass inherits from the superclass
- subclass can add new methods and instance variables of its own, and it can override the methods it inherits from the superclass
- when we call a method on an object reference, we are calling the lowest method in the inheritance hierarchy
- use IS-A and HAS-A test to determine inheritance hierarchy
- use `super.method()` to access superclass's method in subclass method
- access levels control who sees what
	- public members are inherited
	- private members are note inherited
- use inheritance when one class is a more specific type of a superclass
- consider inheritance when you have behavior that should be shared among multiple classes of the same general type
- don't use inheritance just so that you can reuse code from another class
- don't use inheritance if the subclass and superclass don't pass the IS-A test

- inheritance lets you guarantee that all classes grouped under a certain supertype have all the methods that supertype has

	- the reference type can be the superclass of the actual object type
- with polymorphism, you can write code that doesn't have to change when you introduce new subclass types into the program
- the override method should have the same arguments and return types as the overridden method
	- the method also cannot be less accessible
- an overloaded method is just a different method that happens to have the same method name
