- `static` lets a method run without any instance of the class
	- it means that method's behavior doesn't depend on an instance varaible
	- static methods can't use non-static instance variables and methods
	- we can call static method on a reference variable, but the code can be misleading
- all instances of the same class share a single copy of the static variables
	- static variables are initialized when a class is loaded
	- static variables in a class are initialized before any object of that class is created or any static method of that class runs
	- like instance variables, static variables are assigned to default values if they are not initialized
	- a variable marked `final` means that once it is initialized, it can never change

- a final variable means we can't change it's value, a final method means we can't override the method, a final class means we can't extend the class
- when we need to treat a primitive like an object, wrap it
- autoboxing make the conversion between primitives and objects easy
	- it lest us use either a primitive or its wrapper type anywhere one or the other is expected
