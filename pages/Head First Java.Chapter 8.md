- some classes should not be instantiated
	- use `abstract` keyword in front of class declaration to make a class unable to instantiate
	- we can still use the abstract type as a reference type
- method can also be abstract
	- an abstract method means it must be overridden
	- an abstract method has no body
	- if we declare an abstract method, we must make the class abstract as well
- class Object is the mother of all classes, it's the superclass of everything
	- any class that doesn't explicitly extend another class, implicitly extends Object
	- act as a polymorphic type for methods that need to work on any class that we makes
	- provide real method code that all objects in Java need at runtime
- the compiler decides whether we can call a method based on the reference type, not the actual object type
- Java prevents multiple inheritance
- the interfaces make every method abstract
- classes from different inheritance tress can implement the same interface
