- Java RMI gives us the client and service helper objects, so that we can invoke remote method as if we are invoking local method
	- server implementation
		- make a remote interface
			- extend `Remote` interface
			- declare all the remote methods
			- the return values of the methods must be primitives or serializable
		- make a remote implementation
			- implement the remote interface
			- extend `UnicastRemoteObject`
			- declare a constructor that will throw exception like `UnicastRemoteObject` does
			- register the service with the RMI registry
		- generate the stubs and skeletons using rmic
		- start the RMI registry
		- start the remote service
	- the client lookup the RMI registry for the desired stub
		- the client also need to have stub class
- servlets are Java programs that run on an HTTP web server that can be called by the clients
	- find out where our servlets need to be placed
	- get the `servlets.jar`
	- write a servlet class by extending `HttpServlet`
	- allow servlet invocation through web page
	- make both our servlet and HTML page available to our server
