- the iterator pattern provides a way to access the elements of an aggregate object sequentially without exposing its underlying representation
	- the responsibility of traversing elements is on iterator object, not aggregate object, so aggregate object can focus on its duty

- a class should have only one reason to change
	- every responsibility of a class is an area of potential change
- the composite pattern alows you to compose objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies, composite lets clients treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly
	- we can ignore the differences between compositions of objects and individual objects
