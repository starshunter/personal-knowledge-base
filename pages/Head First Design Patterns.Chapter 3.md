- classes should be open for extension, but closed for modification
  id:: 621795e4-2850-4770-87b4-8dcff63087a3
	- allow classes to be easily extended to incorporate new behavior without modifying existing code
	- to achieve this, we need to design our classes that are resilient to change but flexible to take on new functionality
- properties of decorators
	- decorators have the same supertype as the objects they decorate
	- you can use one or more decorators to wrap an object
	- we can pass around a decorated object in place of the original object
	- decorators add theirs own behavior before or after delegating to the object it decorates
	- we can decorate objects dynamically at runtime
- the decorator pattern attaches additional responsibilities to an object dynamically, and decorators provide a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality
