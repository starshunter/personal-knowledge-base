- the observer pattern defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all of its dependents are notified and updated automatically

- loosely coupled designs allow us to build flexible OO systems that can handle change because they minimize the interdependency between objects
	- subject only knows an observer implements a certain interface
	- we can add new observers at any time
	- we never need to modify subject to add new types of observers
	- we can reuse subjects or observers independently of each other
	- changes to either the subject or an observer will not affect the other
- instead of pushing changes from subject to observers, subject can just notify the observers that a change has occurred, and let those observers to choose which data to pull from the subject
